To estimate the coverage error for web surveys in Europe over time, we analyzed data from the Eurobarometer. The Eurobarometer collects data for the European Community across member and applicant states. Since 2005, the Eurobarometer has contained a straightforward question on Internet access. We compared respondents with and without Internet access and estimated coverage bias for demographic variables (sex, age, length of education) and sociopolitical variables (left-right position on a political scale, life satisfaction). Countries in Europe do differ in Internet penetration and resulting coverage bias. Over time, Internet penetration dramatically increases and coverage bias decreases, but the rate of change differs across countries. In addition, the countries' development significantly affects the pace of these changes.",2-s2.0-84888407679,1,2013,Journal of Official Statistics,1

Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) bring together a global crowd of thousands of learners for several weeks or months. In theory, the openness and scale of MOOCs can promote iterative dialogue that facilitates group cognition and knowledge construction. Using data from two successive instances of a popular business strategy MOOC, we filter observed communication patterns to arrive at the significant interaction networks between learnersand use complex network analysis to explore the vulnerability and information diffusion potential of the discussion forums. We find that different discussion topics and pedagogical practices promote varying levels of 1) significant peer-to-peer engagement, 2) participant inclusiveness in dialogue, and ultimately, 3) modularity, which impacts information diffusion to prevent a truly global exchange of knowledge and learning. These results indicate the structural limitations of large-scale crowd-based learning and highlight the different ways that learners in MOOCs leverage, and learn within, social contexts. We conclude by exploring how these insights may inspire new developments in online education.",2-s2.0-84923356212,1,2014,Scientific Reports,1

Recommender systems (RS) are a real-world application domain for Artificial Intelligence standing at the core of massively used e-commerce and social-media platforms like Amazon, Netflix, Spotify and many more. The research field of recommendation systems now has already a more than 20 years long tradition and issues like replication of results and reproducibility of algorithms become more important. Therefore this work is oriented towards better understanding the underlying challenges of reproducibility of offline measurements of recommendation techniques. We therefore introduce rrecsys, an open-source package in R, that implements many popular RS algorithms, expansion capabilities and has an integrated offline evaluation mechanism following an accepted methodology.

The increasingly large amount of data produced in healthcare (e.g. collected through health information systems such as electronic medical records-EMRs or collected through novel data sources such as personal health records-PHRs, social media, web resources) enable the creation of detailed records about people's health, sentiments and activities (e.g. physical activity, diet, sleep quality) that can be used in the public health area among others. However, despite the transformative potential of big data in public health surveillance there are several challenges in integrating big data. In this paper, the interoperability challenge is tackled and a semantic Extract Transform Load (ETL) service is proposed that seeks to semantically annotate big data to result into valuable data for analysis. This service is considered as part of a health analytics engine on the cloud that interacts with existing healthcare information exchange networks, like the Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise (IHE), PHRs, sensors, mobile applications, and other web resources to retrieve patient health, behavioral and daily activity data. The semantic ETL service aims at semantically integrating big data for use by analytic mechanisms. An illustrative implementation of the service on big data which is potentially relevant to human obesity, enables using appropriate analytic techniques (e.g. machine learning, text mining) that are expected to assist in identifying patterns and contributing factors (e.g. genetic background, social, environmental) for this social phenomenon and, hence, drive health policy changes and promote healthy behaviors where residents live, work, learn, shop and play.",2-s2.0-84937469235,0,2015,Studies in Health Technology and Informatics,1

Purpose: By doing sentiment analysis of netnographic data, this study aims to explain the need to give special attention to negative sentiments expressed in virtual tribes, as they play a significant role in translating the informational mode of conversation to the relational mode of conversation. The overall purpose is to aid brand managers in the process of brand co-creation by articulating brand communication targeted to specific audiences based on their shared passions and interests. Design/methodology/approach: The study adopts a mixed-methods approach. The primary data were collected from two virtual brand communities through qualitative net-based ethnographic methods. Semantria Excel plug-in was used to categorize the extracted consumer statements based on positive, neutral and negative sentiments. Findings: Managing the negative interactions in the virtual communities and relationship development with members through non-commercial conversations should be the two main priorities for effective brand management. Sentiment analysis specifically helps to identify pain points and consumer sentiments at each stage of the shopper journey. The findings of the study endorse the importance of offering and supporting communities as a valid marketing. Research limitations/implications: This paper shows how systematic attention to user interactions on virtual brand communities can be used for tribal marketing, which in turn will impact the intangible aspects of the business, such as increasing brand value and loyalty. By engaging the consumers, the social ties among the target audience can be nurtured and strengthened. Originality/value: This paper focuses on decoding their behavior by unpeeling the consumer statements rather than tangible aspects of the business, such as sales of products or services. It contributes to development of a theoretical framework that outlines how the interactions in virtual brand communities can aid in formulating the functional and communicational strategies for a brand.",2-s2.0-85014769786,1,2017,Journal of Research in Interactive Marketing,1

Examination of temporally changing adaptive social networks has been difficult given the need for extensive and usually real-time data collection. Building from interdisciplinary advances, the authors propose a web search engine-based method (called retrospective relatedness reconstruction or 3R) for collecting approximated historical data of temporally changing adaptive social networks. As quantifying relatedness among people in social networks leads to difficulty in assigning proper weights to relationship ties, 3R offers a means for assessing relatedness between people over time. Additionally, 3R can be applied beyond people relatedness to include word associations. To illustrate these two novel contributions, the authors reconstructed the temporal evolution of a social network from 2005 to 2009 of 92 individuals (key leaders) related to the U.S. financial crisis and also examined the temporal evolution of social sentiment (i.e., fear, shame, blame, confidence) related to the same 92 individuals.

Background: Accurate and timely detection of public health events of international concern is necessary to help support risk assessment and response and save lives. Novel event-based methods that use the World Wide Web as a signal source offer potential to extend health surveillance into areas where traditional indicator networks are lacking. In this paper we address the issue of systematically evaluating online health news to support automatic alerting using daily disease-country counts text mined from real world data using BioCaster. For 18 data sets produced by BioCaster, we compare 5 aberration detection algorithms (EARS C2, C3, W2, F-statistic and EWMA) for performance against expert moderated ProMED-mail postings.Results: We report sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), mean alerts/100 days and F1, at 95% confidence interval (CI) for 287 ProMED-mail postings on 18 outbreaks across 14 countries over a 366 day period. Results indicate that W2 had the best F1 with a slight benefit for day of week effect over C2. In drill down analysis we indicate issues arising from the granular choice of country-level modeling, sudden drops in reporting due to day of week effects and reporting bias. Automatic alerting has been implemented in BioCaster available from http://born.nii.ac.jp.Conclusions: Online health news alerts have the potential to enhance manual analytical methods by increasing throughput, timeliness and detection rates. Systematic evaluation of health news aberrations is necessary to push forward our understanding of the complex relationship between news report volumes and case numbers and to select the best performing features and algorithms.",2-s2.0-80053406335,1,2010,Journal of Biomedical Semantics,1

This paper surveys the methods underlying the burgeoning body of leadership and management research on social networks and social capital (SNSC). A social network is a social structure made up of nodes connected by a set of ties. Social capital, in turn, refers to the structure, content, and perception of one's social relationships in the network. This paper presents an in-depth survey of the methods of using SNSC in leadership and management research. I first review how network scholars determine network boundaries, choose sampling techniques, and collect network data. I follow with a comprehensive survey of the statistical tools and analytical strategies prevalent in SNSC research. I then investigate the methodological rigor of 110 SNSC empirical studies in leadership and other management fields. My results show that 8.1% (3/37) specified network boundaries, 43.2% (49/103) used surveys to collect network data, and 52.3% (58/110) implemented at least one reviewed method. A further assessment reveals that only 39.7% (23/58) of papers somewhat justified the appropriateness of using such methods. The frequency distribution of coding criteria was similar across journals and over time.

In this paper, we propose a novel system named 'online commercial intention (OCI) detection system' using users' global web browsing history to predict potential purchasing products on an online shopping platform. A 'commercial keyword dictionary (KD)' that reveals the relationship between user queries and product categories is firstly set up by analysing the click distribution of billion queries on the shopping platform. Footprints of millions of internet users are gathered and the raw page contents are crawled. Keywords in these pages are extracted using N-gram algorithm and commercial probabilities are estimated with query frequency (QF), inverse category frequency (ICF), etc. The page OCI is estimated by merging the KD matrices of its commercial keywords. In order to increase categories' coherence and accuracy, we provide a category similarity model to observe the distance between top N categories.

The common sentiment behavior towards these topics is received through the massive number of instant messages about them. In this paper, rather than using the opinion polarity of each message relevant to the topic, authors focus on sentence level opinion classification upon using the unsupervised algorithm named bigram item response theory (BIRT). It differs from the traditional classification and document level classification algorithm.

Our interest in examining this data is in spatial communication preferences by the network users, that is, to ascertain who is communicating with whom and where. Our analysis of 12,000 messages exchanged between 530 managers shows that interactions can generally be characterized by individual preferences for local communication but also that two different user communities exist - 'locals' and 'globals'.

Can we assist consumers in their privacy decision-making practices, for example by predicting their preferences and giving them personalized advice? In order to accomplish this, we would need to study the factors that affect users' privacy decision-making practices. In this paper, we intend to comprehensively investigate these factors in light of two common OSN scenarios: the case where other users request access to the user's information, and the case where the user shares this information voluntarily. Using a real-life dataset from Google+ and three location-sharing datasets, we identify behavioral analogs to psychological variables that are known to affect users' disclosure behavior: the trustworthiness of the requester/information audience, the sharing tendency of the receiver/information holder, the sensitivity of the requested/shared information, the appropriateness of the request/sharing activity, as well as some contextual information. We also explore how these factors work to affect the privacy decision making.

This opens possibilities to profile people based on the places they visit, people they associate with, or other aspects of their complex routines determined through persistent tracking. It is possible that services offering customized information based on the results of such behavioral profiling could become commonplace. However, it may not be immediately apparent to the user that a wealth of information about them, potentially unrelated to the service, can be revealed. Further issues occur if the user agreed, while subscribing to the service, for data to be passed to third parties where it may be used to their detriment. Here, we report in detail on a short case study tracking four people, in three European member states, persistently for six weeks using mobile handsets. The GPS locations of these people have been mined to reveal places of interest and to create simple profiles.

Epidemic processes on temporal networks are complicated by complexity of both network structure and temporal dimensions. Theoretical approaches are much needed for identifying key factors that affect dynamics of epidemics. In particular, what factors make some temporal networks stronger media of infection than other temporal networks is under debate. We develop a theory to understand the susceptible-infected-susceptible epidemic model on arbitrary temporal networks, where each contact is used for a finite duration. We show that temporality of networks lessens the epidemic threshold such that infections persist more easily in temporal networks than in their static counterparts. We further show that the Lie commutator bracket of the adjacency matrices at different times is a key determinant of the epidemic threshold in temporal networks.

Methods: We explored databases, catalogues and registries with respect to their accessibility, geographical and taxonomic extent, sample bias and other types of uncertainty, from the perspective both users and contributors. We identified four kinds of big data needed to predict the impacts of global change on plant populations and communities using spatially explicit models: remotely sensed and other environmental maps, species occurrence records, community composition (plots) and species traits, especially demographics. Results: Digital environmental maps, including remotely sensed data, are the most mature class of big data discussed herein whereby protocols for archiving, discovering and analysing them have developed over three decades. Species locality records are being aggregated into databases that are easy to search and access, and while methods for addressing uncertainties are a major research focus, better spatial representation is still needed. Plot data from inventories have tremendous potential for monitoring and modelling the impacts of global change on plant communities but tend to be restricted to forests or concentrated in certain geographical areas. Ongoing efforts to aggregate plot and trait data from multiple sources are challenged by their heterogeneous coverage, attributes and protocols and a lack of data standards. Main conclusions: Future goals include developing systematic frameworks for selecting geospatial data, improving tools for assessing the quality of species occurrence records and increased aggregation and discoverability of plot and trait data. Aggregated data collected by scientists, not sensors, provide more meaningful insights when data collectors are involved in analysis.",2-s2.0-84992152211,0,2017,Global Ecology and Biogeography,1

Recently, many efforts have been spent on observing individual's psychological states through analyzing users' social activities on SNS. In this paper, we propose a novel method for identifying the users with depressive moods by analyzing their daily tweets for a long period of time. Then, for more accurately understand their tweets, we exploit all media types of tweets, i.e., images and emoticons as well as texts, thus develop a multimodal method for analyzing them. In the proposed method, three single-modal analyses are first performed for extract the hidden users' moods from text, emoticon, and images: a learning based text analysis, a word-based emoticon analysis, and a SVM based image classifier. Thereafter, the extracted moods from the respective analyses are integrated into a mood and again aggregated per a day, which allows for continuous monitoring of user's mood trends. To assess the validity of the proposed method, two types of experiments were performed: 1) the proposed multimodal analysis was tested with a number of tweets, and its performance was compared to SentiStrength; 2) it was applied to classify 45 users' mental states as depressive and non-depressive ones. Then, the results demonstrated that the proposed method outperforms the baseline, and it is effective in finding depressive moods for users.",2-s2.0-84964680303,1,2016,"2016 International Conference on Big Data and Smart Computing, BigComp 2016",1

Fresh, bias-free and valid data collected using different survey modes is considered an essential requirement for smooth functioning and evolution of an organization. Surveys play a major role in making in-time and correct decisions and generating reports. The aim of this study is to compare and investigate state-of-the-art in different survey modes including print, email, online, mobile and SMS-based surveys. Results indicate that existing methods are neither complete nor sufficient to fulfill the overall requirements of an organization which primarily rely on surveys. It also shows that SMS is a dominant method for data collection due to its pervasiveness. However, existing SMS-based data collection has limitations like limited number of characters per SMS, single question per SMS and lake of multimedia support. Recent trends emphasis on smartphones applications for data collection. However, in developing countries low-end mobile devices are still extensively used which makes the data collection difficult from man in the street. The paper concludes that existing survey modes and methods need an improvement to get maximum responses quickly in the lowest possible cost. The study has contributed to the area of surveying and data collection by analysing different factors such as cost, time and response rate. The results of this study can help practitioners in creating new methods and tools for data collection that can be effectively used for low budget projects in developed as well as developing countries.",2-s2.0-84907371563,1,2014,Pakistan Journal of Statistics and Operation Research,1

With the proliferation of online social networking (OSN) and mobile devices, preserving user privacy has become a great challenge. While prior studies have directly focused on OSN services, we call attention to the privacy leakage in mobile network data. This concern is motivated by two factors. First, the prevalence of OSN usage leaves identifiable digital footprints that can be traced back to users in the real-world. Second, the association between users and their mobile devices makes it easier to associate traffic to its owners. These pose a serious threat to user privacy as they enable an adversary to attribute significant portions of data traffic including the ones with NO identity leaks to network users' true identities. To demonstrate its feasibility, we develop the Tessellation methodology. By applying Tessellation on traffic from a cellular service provider (CSP), we show that up to 50% of the traffic can be attributed to the names of users. In addition to revealing the user identity, the reconstructed profile, dubbed as ""mosaic,"" associates personal information such as political views, browsing habits, and favorite apps to the users. We conclude by discussing approaches for preventing and mitigating the alarming leakage of sensitive user information.",2-s2.0-84883268126,1,2013,"SIGCOMM 2013 - Proceedings of the ACM SIGCOMM 2013 Conference on Applications, Technologies, Architectures, and Protocols for Computer Communication",1

We examine the political alignments and networking of Twitter users, analyzing 9 million tweets produced by more than 23,000 randomly selected followers of candidates for the U.S. House and Senate and governorships in 2010. We find that Twitter users in that election cycle did not align in a simple Right-Left division; rather, five unique clusters emerged within Twitter networks, three of them representing different conservative groupings. Going beyond discourses of fragmentation and polarization, certain clusters engaged in strategic expression such as “retweeting” (i.e., sharing someone else’s tweet with one’s followers) and “hashjacking” (i.e., co-opting the hashtags preferred by political adversaries).

Although online recommendation systems such as recommendation of movies or music have been systematically studied in the past decade, location recommendation in Location Based Social Networks (LBSNs) is not well investigated yet. In LBSNs, users can check in and leave tips commenting on a venue. These two heterogeneous data sources both describe users' preference of venues. However, in current research work, only users' check-in behavior is considered in users' location preference model, users' tips on venues are seldom investigated yet. Moreover, while existing work mainly considers social influence in recommendation, we argue that considering venue similarity can further improve the recommendation performance. In this research, we ameliorate location recommendation by enhancing not only the user location preference model but also recommendation algorithm. First, we propose a hybrid user location preference model by combining the preference extracted from check-ins and text-based tips which are processed using sentiment analysis techniques. Second, we develop a location based social matrix factorization algorithm that takes both user social influence and venue similarity influence into account in location recommendation. Using two datasets extracted from the location based social networks Foursquare, experiment results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid preference model can better characterize user preference by maintaining the preference consistency, and the proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

32,14626,"Maalej W., Kurtanović Z., Nabil H., Stanik C.",On the automatic classification of app reviews,"On the automatic classification of app reviews. App stores like Google Play and Apple AppStore have over 3 million apps covering nearly every kind of software and service. Billions of users regularly download, use, and review these apps. Recent studies have shown that reviews written by the users represent a rich source of information for the app vendors and the developers, as they include information about bugs, ideas for new features, or documentation of released features. The majority of the reviews, however, is rather non-informative just praising the app and repeating to the star ratings in words. This paper introduces several probabilistic techniques to classify app reviews into four types: bug reports, feature requests, user experiences, and text ratings. For this, we use review metadata such as the star rating and the tense, as well as, text classification, natural language processing, and sentiment analysis techniques. We conducted a series of experiments to compare the accuracy of the techniques and compared them with simple string matching. We found that metadata alone results in a poor classification accuracy. When combined with simple text classification and natural language preprocessing of the text—particularly with bigrams and lemmatization—the classification precision for all review types got up to 88–92 % and the recall up to 90–99 %. Multiple binary classifiers outperformed single multiclass classifiers. Our results inspired the design of a review analytics tool, which should help app vendors and developers deal with the large amount of reviews, filter critical reviews, and assign them to the appropriate stakeholders. We describe the tool main features and summarize nine interviews with practitioners on how review analytics tools including ours could be used in practice.",2-s2.0-84968538213,1,2016,Requirements Engineering,1

Background: High rates of physical inactivity compromise the health status of populations globally. Social networks have been shown to influence physical activity (PA), but little is known about how best to engineer social networks to sustain PA. To improve procedures for building networks that shape PA as a normative behavior, there is a need for more specific hypotheses about how social variables influence PA. There is also a need to integrate concepts from network science with ecological concepts that often guide the design of in-person and electronically-mediated interventions. Therefore, this paper: (1) proposes a conceptual model that integrates principles from network science and ecology across in-person and electronically-mediated intervention modes; and (2) illustrates the application of this model to the design and evaluation of a social network intervention for PA. Methods/Design. A conceptual model for engineering social networks was developed based on a scoping literature review of modifiable social influences on PA. The model guided the design of a cluster randomized controlled trial in which 308 sedentary adults were randomly assigned to three groups: WalkLink+: prompted and provided feedback on participants' online and in-person social-network interactions to expand networks for PA, plus provided evidence-based online walking program and weekly walking tips; WalkLink: evidence-based online walking program and weekly tips only; Minimal Treatment Control: weekly tips only. The effects of these treatment conditions were assessed at baseline, post-program, and 6-month follow-up. The primary outcome was accelerometer-measured PA. Secondary outcomes included objectively-measured aerobic fitness, body mass index, waist circumference, blood pressure, and neighborhood walkability; and self-reported measures of the physical environment, social network environment, and social network interactions. The differential effects of the three treatment conditions on primary and secondary outcomes will be analyzed using general linear modeling (GLM), or generalized linear modeling if the assumptions for GLM cannot be met. Discussion. Results will contribute to greater understanding of how to conceptualize and implement social networks to support long-term PA. Establishing social networks for PA across multiple life settings could contribute to cultural norms that sustain active living. Trial registration.

Background. Previous studies identifying associations between influenza and acute cardiac events may have been confounded by climatic factors. Differing seasonal patterns of influenza activity in Hong Kong and England and Wales provide a natural experiment to examine associations with myocardial infarction (MI) independent of cold weather effects. Methods. Weekly clinical and laboratory influenza surveillance data, environmental temperature and humidity data, and counts of MI-associated hospitalizations and deaths were obtained for England and Wales and for Hong Kong for the period 1998-2008. We used Poisson regression models that included environmental and seasonal variables to investigate the relationship between influenza and MI. Results. There were ≥ 1.2 million MI-associated hospitalizations and 410,204 MI-associated deaths in England and Wales, with a marked peak in the winter season. In Hong Kong, the incidence of MI, on the basis of 65,108 hospitalizations and 18,780 deaths, had a large winter and smaller summer peak, mirroring patterns of influenza activity. There was strong evidence for a link between influenza and MI both in England and Wales, where 3.1%-3.4% of MI-associated deaths (P < .001) and 0.7%-1.2% of MI-associated hospitalizations (P < .001) were attributable to influenza, and in Hong Kong, where the corresponding figures were 3.9%-5.6% (P = .018) and 3.0%-3.3% (P = .002).

However, in practice activc surveillance is difficult to implement especially when monitoring space is large but available resources are limited. Therefore, it is extremely important for public health authorities to know how to distribute their very sparse resources to high-priority regions so as to maximize the outcomes of active surveillance. In this paper, we raise the problem of active surveillance planning and provide an effective method to address it via modeling and mining spatiotemporal patterns of infection risks from heterogeneous data sources.

This article considers the concept of media and citizenship in relation to the politics of representation on the South African Broadcasting Corporation's channel 2 (SABC2). It examines the ways in which a group of audience members negotiate and reflect upon issues of representation on SABC2's flagship soap opera 7de Laan, which professes to be a multicultural soap opera, paying reverence to the diverse cultural, ethnic and linguistic make-up of South Africa. In previous work, I have argued that the soap opera presents a utopian view of community and citizenship in contemporary South Africa. Building on this observation, this article explores audience engagement with 7de Laan's utopian construction of South African citizenship through a social networking site, Twitter. It examines the ways in which a group of audience members negotiate and reflect upon issues of representation on 7de Laan through the Twitter hashtag #7delaan, arguing that Twitter provides a platform for viewer fans engaged in a love/hate relationship with television to 'bamboozle back'. My primary interest in the #7delaan community is therefore centred not only on what the community members tweet but more so on how their tweets frame the soap opera and their perceptions thereof, and to try to understand what these discourses might reveal about their perceptions of place, race and citizenship in contemporary South Africa.",2-s2.0-84940392119,1,2015,Journal of African Media Studies,1

Background: Real-time surveillance is fundamental for effective control of disease outbreaks, but the official sentinel surveillance in Japan collects information related to disease activity only weekly and updates it with a 1-week time lag. Objective: To report on a prescription surveillance system using electronic records related to prescription drugs that was started in 2008 in Japan, and to evaluate the surveillance system for monitoring influenza activity during the 2009-2010 and 2010-2011 influenza seasons. Methods: We developed an automatic surveillance system using electronic records of prescription drug purchases collected from 5275 pharmacies through the application service provider's medical claims service. We then applied the system to monitoring influenza activity during the 2009-2010 and 2010-2011 influenza seasons. The surveillance system collected information related to drugs and patients directly and automatically from the electronic prescription record system, and estimated the number of influenza cases based on the number of prescriptions of anti-influenza virus medication. Then it shared the information related to influenza activity through the Internet with the public on a daily basis. Results: During the 2009-2010 influenza season, the number of influenza patients estimated by the prescription surveillance system between the 28th week of 2009 and the 12th week of 2010 was 9,234,289. In the 2010-2011 influenza season, the number of influenza patients between the 36th week of 2010 and the 12th week of 2011 was 7,153,437. The estimated number of influenza cases was highly correlated with that predicted by the official sentinel surveillance (r = .992, P < .001 for 2009-2010; r = .972, P < .001 for 2010-2011), indicating that the prescription surveillance system produced a good approximation of activity patterns.

Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential contribution of mining social media networks for medicines safety surveillance using the following associations as case studies: (1) rosiglitazone and cardiovascular events (i.e. stroke and myocardial infarction); and (2) human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccine and infertility. Methods: We collected publicly accessible, English-language posts on Facebook, Google+, and Twitter until September 2014. Data were queried for co-occurrence of keywords related to the drug/vaccine and event of interest within a post. Messages were analysed with respect to geographical distribution, context, linking to other web content, and author’s assertion regarding the supposed association. Results: A total of 2537 posts related to rosiglitazone/cardiovascular events and 2236 posts related to HPV vaccine/infertility were retrieved, with the majority of posts representing data from Twitter (98 and 85 %, respectively) and originating from users in the US. Approximately 21 % of rosiglitazone-related posts and 84 % of HPV vaccine-related posts referenced other web pages, mostly news items, law firms’ websites, or blogs. Assertion analysis predominantly showed affirmation of the association of rosiglitazone/cardiovascular events (72 %; n = 1821) and of HPV vaccine/infertility (79 %; n = 1758). Only ten posts described personal accounts of rosiglitazone/cardiovascular adverse event experiences, and nine posts described HPV vaccine problems related to infertility. Conclusions: Publicly available data from the considered social media networks were sparse and largely untrackable for the purpose of providing early clues of safety concerns regarding the prespecified case studies.

Purpose: Big data clearly represent an important advance in information systems theory, but to describe it as “revolutionary” is premature. Similar technological breakthroughs, from online databases to ERP, were clearly modulated by advances in the organizational domain, including matters of structure, strategy and culture and arguably big data will be similar. The purpose of this paper is to encourage discussion of the wider implications of big data for the theory and practice of knowledge management. Design/methodology/approach: This is a conceptual study based on critical analysis of the relevant literatures including those of organizational studies and management, big data and knowledge management. Findings: The literature of big data emphasizes the application of algorithms to pattern analysis and prediction, resulting in data-driven decision-making, with data being the creator of value in organizations and societies. This would appear to render obsolete previous depictions of the “data-information-knowledge” relationship and, in effect, spell the end of knowledge management. However, big data literature largely ignores the organizational dimension and, significantly, the importance of frameworks, strategies and cultures for big data. As all of these are present in the literature of knowledge management, it would seem that big data have a long way to go to catch up and qualify even as a sub-discipline. Indeed, on the evidence, big data may well have a future as a contributor to and/or an element of knowledge management. Even for this to happen, however, major advances are required across the spectrum of big data technologies. Research limitations/implications: This is a position paper written as the precursor for an empirical study. Originality/value: The paper offers a critical literature-based and knowledge management perspective on big data while pointing out the common thread that runs through decades of advances in information systems technologies.",2-s2.0-85014750510,1,2017,Journal of Knowledge Management,1

However, traditional surveillance approaches, e.g., U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), publish the TB morbidity surveillance results on a quarterly basis, with months of reporting lag. Moreover, in some developing countries, where most infections occur, there may not be enough medical resources to build traditional surveillance systems. To improve early detection of TB outbreaks, we developed a syndromic approach to estimate the actual number of TB cases using Google search volume. Specifically, the search volume of 19 TB-related terms, obtained from January 2004 to April 2009, were examined for surveillance purpose. Contemporary TB surveillance data were extracted from the CDCs reports to build and evaluate the syndromic system. We estimate the actual TB occurrences using a nonstationary dynamic system. Respective models are built to monitor both national-level and state-level TB activities.

Large-scale data from social media have a significant potential to describe complex phenomena in the real world and to anticipate collective behaviors such as information spreading and social trends. One specific case of study is represented by the collective attention to the action of political parties. Not surprisingly, researchers and stakeholders tried to correlate parties' presence on social media with their performances in elections. Despite the many efforts, results are still inconclusive since this kind of data is often very noisy and significant signals could be covered by (largely unknown) statistical fluctuations. In this paper we consider the number of tweets (tweet volume) of a party as a proxy of collective attention to the party, identify the dynamics of the volume, and show that this quantity has some information on the election outcome. We find that the distribution of the tweet volume for each party follows a log-normal distribution with a positive autocorrelation of the volume over short terms, which indicates the volume has large fluctuations of the log-normal distribution yet with a short-term tendency. Furthermore, by measuring the ratio of two consecutive daily tweet volumes, we find that the evolution of the daily volume of a party can be described by means of a geometric Brownian motion (i.e., the logarithm of the volume moves randomly with a trend). Finally, we determine the optimal period of averaging tweet volume for reducing fluctuations and extracting short-term tendencies. We conclude that the tweet volume is a good indicator of parties' success in the elections when considered over an optimal time window. Our study identifies the statistical nature of collective attention to political issues and sheds light on how to model the dynamics of collective attention in social media.",2-s2.0-84940546981,0,2015,PLoS ONE,1

Searching for influential spreaders in complex networks is an issue of great significance for applications across various domains, ranging from epidemic control, innovation diffusion, viral marketing, and social movement to idea propagation. In this paper, we first display some of the most important theoretical models that describe spreading processes, and then discuss the problem of locating both the individual and multiple influential spreaders respectively. Recent approaches in these two topics are presented. For the identification of privileged single spreaders, we summarize several widely used centralities, such as degree, betweenness centrality, PageRank, k-shell, etc. We investigate the empirical diffusion data in a large scale online social community - LiveJournal. With this extensive dataset, we find that various measures can convey very distinct information of nodes. Of all the users in the LiveJournal social network, only a small fraction of them are involved in spreading. For the spreading processes in LiveJournal, while degree can locate nodes participating in information diffusion with higher probability, k-shell is more effective in finding nodes with a large influence.

Our findings show that reviews with higher levels of positive sentiment in the title receive more readerships. Sentimental reviews with neutral polarity in the text are also perceived to be more helpful. The length and longevity of a review positively influence both its readership and helpfulness.

Social networks play an important role in Web 2.0. For many users establishing contacts and staying in touch in the virtual world is more than just a spare time filler. In social networks like Facebook they provide much information about themselves in user profiles. Also for online dating the focus is on establishing new contacts. In general, three types of dating sites can be distinguished: more serious dating agencies, less focused singles' platforms, and casual dating sites. In the proposed paper we develop a product advisor that uses the Facebook profile information provided by a user to classify her or him to one of the three dating site categories which is most suitable for the user's purpose. For classification we use Naive Bayes. To train the classifier we investigate the correlation between profile information and choice of dating sites. We also evaluate this correlation on collected data of representative German dating sites.

We address the problem of calibration of workers whose task is to label patterns with continuous variables, which arises for instance in labeling images of videos of humans with continuous traits. Worker bias is particularly difficult to evaluate and correct when many workers contribute just a few labels, a situation arising typically when labeling is crowd-sourced. In the scenario of labeling short videos of people facing a camera with personality traits, we evaluate the feasibility of the pairwise ranking method to alleviate bias problems. Workers are exposed to pairs of videos at a time and must order by preference. The variable levels are reconstructed by fitting a Bradley-Terry-Luce model with maximum likelihood. This method may at first sight, seem prohibitively expensive because for N videos, p = N(N − 1)/2 pairs must be potentially processed by workers rather that N videos. However, by performing extensive simulations, we determine an empirical law for the scaling of the number of pairs needed as a function of the number of videos in order to achieve a given accuracy of score reconstruction and show that the pairwise method is affordable. We apply the method to the labeling of a large scale dataset of 10,000 videos used in the ChaLearn Apparent Personality Trait challenge.",2-s2.0-85006054811,1,2016,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),1

Stimulated by these facts, we develop C5, a collaborative content fetching scheme for groups of mobile subscribers with common characteristics. C5 makes a number of new contributions over prior work: (a) a small scale P2SP framework of a hybrid mobile network which considers possible concurrent mobile Internet traffic to maximize the utility of WWAN links; (b) support of MAC layer multicast in community and a new community formation procedure with the multicast rate estimation; (c) an application-level fetching procedure for both server and peer clients. We also formulate the content fetching process in C5 into an optimization problem and give a simple method to estimate the bound of the objective function.

We show how a common text-mining method (latent Dirichlet allocation, or topic modeling) and statistical tests familiar to ecologists (cluster analysis, regression, and network analysis) can be used to investigate trends and identify potential research gaps in the scientific literature. We tested these methods on the literature on ecological surrogates and indicators. Analysis of topic popularity within this corpus showed a strong emphasis on monitoring and management of fragmented ecosystems, while analysis of research gaps suggested a greater role for genetic surrogates and indicators.

In this paper we investigate the attributes and relative influence of 1.6M Twitter users by tracking 74 million diffusion events that took place on the Twitter follower graph over a two month interval in 2009. Unsurprisingly, we find that the largest cascades tend to be generated by users who have been influential in the past and who have a large number of followers. We also find that URLs that were rated more interesting and/or elicited more positive feelings by workers on Mechanical Turk were more likely to spread. In spite of these intuitive results, however, we find that predictions of which particular user or URL will generate large cascades are relatively unreliable. We conclude, therefore, that wordof-mouth diffusion can only be harnessed reliably by targeting large numbers of potential influencers, thereby capturing average effects. Finally, we consider a family of hypothetical marketing strategies, defined by the relative cost of identifying versus compensating potential ""influencers."" We find that although under some circumstances, the most influential users are also the most cost-effective, under a wide range of plausible assumptions the most cost-effective performance can be realized using ""ordinary influencers""-individuals who exert average or even less-than-average influence.

Social media, such as social networking platforms, are increasingly gaining importance in enterprise contexts. Enterprise social networking (ESN) is often associated with improved communication, information-sharing and problem-solving. At the same time, ESN has been argued to diminish the role of formal influence in that users increasingly derive authority from their contributions to the network rather than from their position in the organizational hierarchy. Others argue that ESN will diminish influence considerably by producing more democratic and inclusive communication structures. Yet, these assertions have so far remained largely unexplored empirically. Against this background, we explore what influence both a user's position in the organization's hierarchy and a user's contributions on the network have on the the ability to elicit responses from other ESN users. We draw on a unique data set of more than 110,000 messages collected from the ESN platform used at Deloitte Australia. While we find evidence for both kinds of influence, our data also reveals that informal influence has a stronger effect and that, as the ESN community matures over time, communication structures become indeed more inclusive and balanced across hierarchical levels. We contribute a set of propositions that theorize the ways in which influence and communication pattern are shaped during the process of ESN emergence. Our results further underline the potentials of ESN to improve organic, user-driven communication and knowledge sharing within firms.",2-s2.0-84958983223,1,2015,Business and Information Systems Engineering,1

Generating models from large data sets-and determining which subsets of data to mine-is becoming increasingly automated.

This paper describes a new approach to machine science which demonstrates for the first time that nondomain experts can collectively formulate features and provide values for those features such that they are predictive of some behavioral outcome of interest. This was accomplished by building a Web platform in which human groups interact to both respond to questions likely to help predict a behavioral outcome and pose new questions to their peers. This results in a dynamically growing online survey, but the result of this cooperative behavior also leads to models that can predict the user's outcomes based on their responses to the user-generated survey questions. Here, we describe two Web-based experiments that instantiate this approach: The first site led to models that can predict users' monthly electric energy consumption, and the other led to models that can predict users' body mass index. As exponential increases in content are often observed in successful online collaborative communities, the proposed methodology may, in the future, lead to similar exponential rises in discovery and insight into the causal factors of behavioral outcomes.",2-s2.0-84887089092,0,2013,"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Part A:Systems and Humans",1

Additionally, focus groups conducted with 71 study participants explored how students saw the role of social media in their personal and civic lives. The results show a population that increasingly uses social media spaces and for all information and communication needs, but that conceptualizes these platforms as primarily social outlets.

Public cloud storage services are becoming prevalent and myriad data sharing, archiving and collaborative services have emerged which harness the pay-as-you-go business model of public cloud. To ensure privacy and confidentiality often encrypted data is outsourced to such services, which further complicates the process of accessing relevant data by using search queries. Search over encrypted data schemes solve this problem by exploiting cryptographic primitives and secure indexing to identify outsourced data that satisfy the search criteria. Almost all of these schemes rely on exact matching between the encrypted data and search criteria. A few schemes which extend the notion of exact matching to similarity based search, lack realism as those schemes rely on trusted third parties or due to increase storage and computational complexity. In this paper we propose Oblivious Similarity based Search (OS2) for encrypted data. It enables authorized users to model their own encrypted search queries which are resilient to typographical errors. Unlike conventional methodologies, OS2 ranks the search results by using similarity measure offering a better search experience than exact matching. It utilizes encrypted bloom filter and probabilistic homomorphic encryption to enable authorized users to access relevant data without revealing results of search query evaluation process to the untrusted cloud service provider. Encrypted bloom filter based search enables OS2 to reduce search space to potentially relevant encrypted data avoiding unnecessary computation on public cloud.

72,3778,Wu W.,Analyzing word-of-mouth in social media: The impact and generation patterns,"Analyzing word-of-mouth in social media: The impact and generation patterns. Online word-of-mouth (WOM) has been recognized as an important information source in influencing consumer purchase decisions in literature. WOM can influence product sales through both awareness effect and persuasive effect. The explosive growth of social media which allows the creation and exchange of user-generated content (including WOM) is changing the way consumers search for information and communicate with each other. Analyzing the impact of WOM and the generation patterns in the context of social media becomes important. Social broadcasting network is an important type of social media, and user generated contents such as tweets in social broadcasting system have become an important source of WOM. In a social broadcasting system, the awareness effect of WOM is strengthened by the rapid information diffusion, and the persuasive effect of WOM is influenced by social interactions. In my dissertation, I try to investigate the impact of WOM from tweets on product sales while controlling for other WOM sources such as product reviews and blogs. My second research question is the generation patterns of WOM. Generation pattern in my study refers to some specific characters of the rating sequence for a given product. Extant research typically examined the relationship between WOM and product sales by using aggregated WOM data, which ignored the dynamics of WOM generation. In fact, WOM of a product changes from time to time. For two products which have the same aggregated ratings and the same aggregated volumes of ratings, information included in the rating sequence might be different. In my dissertation, I want to identify different patterns of WOM generation, and further to investigate the impact of WOM generation pattern on product sales. To achieve these objectives, I collect data of sales, tweets, reviews, and blogs for a book list from the on-sale calendar of Publishers Weekly. This book list includes all adults' books which published during the period from October 2011 to December 2011. For the methodology, I propose to use data mining tools such as text mining and clustering to extract information in tweets and reviews. Panel data are analysed for the impact of tweets, and time series are used to identify generation patterns.",2-s2.0-84928185384,0,2012,"Proceedings - Pacific Asia Conference on Information Systems, PACIS 2012",1

Introduction: Social media (SM) may extend the reach and impact for smoking cessation among young adult smokers. To-date, little research targeting young adults has been done on the use of SM to promote quitting smoking. We assessed the effect of an innovative multicomponent webbased and SM approach known as Break-it-Off(BIO) on young adult smoking cessation. Methods: The study employed a quasi-experimental design with baseline and 3-month follow-up data from 19 to 29-year old smokers exposed to BIO (n = 102 at follow-up) and a comparison group of Smokers' Helpline (SHL) users (n = 136 at follow-up). Logistic regression analysis assessed differences between groups on self-reported 7-day and 30-day point prevalence cessation rates, adjusting for ethnicity, education level, and cigarette use (daily or occasional) at baseline. Results: The campaign reached 37 325 unique visitors with a total of 44 172 visits. BIO users had significantly higher 7-day and 30-day quit rates compared with users of SHL. At 3-month followup, BIO participants (32.4%) were more likely than SHL participants (14%) to have quit smoking for 30 days (odds ratio = 2.95, 95% CI = 1.56 to 5.57, P <.001) and BIO participants (91%) were more likely than SHL participants (79%) to have made a quit attempt (odds ratio = 2.69, 95% CI = 1.03 to 6.99, P =.04). Conclusion: The reach of the campaign and findings on quitting success indicate that a digital/SM platform can complement the traditional SHL cessation service for young adult smokers seeking help to quit.",2-s2.0-84962789010,1,2016,Nicotine and Tobacco Research,1

Online Social Networks emerged at the beginning of 21st century and give us evidence that they are going to have a long life. Almost two-thirds of overall social media users affirm an everyday usage of a social media website and, therefore, the data volume across this platforms is huge. Natural language processing of social media texts is an attractive topic among researchers of this area. While there are many studies about natural language processing of social media texts for some languages (e.g., English), the researches for Brazilian Portuguese language are still limited. Then, in this paper, a methodology is proposed to deal with peculiarities of the Brazilian Portuguese language in informal, short and noisy texts, where the lack of context poses obstacles in text mining. The proposed methodology has been evaluated in two tasks (Text Categorization and Opinion Mining) and experiments showed that the preprocessing mechanisms included in this methodology were important to achieve better results.",2-s2.0-85001976163,1,2016,WebMedia 2016 - Proceedings of the 22nd Brazilian Symposium on Multimedia and the Web,1

This study analyzes a dataset of 701 U.S. teenagers (ages 12-18) that merges an online survey of social network site (SNS) preferences with administrative records from their public school districts. Using a multinomial logistic model, I examine whether off-line divides across gender, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, self-esteem, and social capital predict teenagers' membership in the popular SNSs, Facebook and Myspace. The results show that the characteristics of teens that use Facebook, Myspace, or both SNSs show distinct differences, which illuminate questions of digital divide and complex adolescent social practices as they relate to online participation. The study offers two main contributions by providing an analysis of: (a) teenage SNS users, a population that is less examined in research on online communities, and (b) the relationship between their off-line characteristics and online social networks.",2-s2.0-84859339955,1,2012,First Monday,1

Purpose: Amazon Mechanical Turk is an increasingly popular data source in the organizational psychology research community. This paper presents an evaluation of MTurk and provides a set of practical recommendations for researchers using MTurk. Design/Methodology/Approach: We present an evaluation of methodological concerns related to the use of MTurk and potential threats to validity inferences. Based on our evaluation, we also provide a set of recommendations to strengthen validity inferences using MTurk samples. Findings: Although MTurk samples can overcome some important validity concerns, there are other limitations researchers must consider in light of their research objectives. Researchers should carefully evaluate the appropriateness and quality of MTurk samples based on the different issues we discuss in our evaluation. Implications: There is not a one-size-fits-all answer to whether MTurk is appropriate for a research study. The answer depends on the research questions and the data collection and analytic procedures adopted. The quality of the data is not defined by the data source per se, but rather the decisions researchers make during the stages of study design, data collection, and data analysis. Originality/Value: The current paper extends the literature by evaluating MTurk in a more comprehensive manner than in prior reviews. Past review papers focused primarily on internal and external validity, with less attention paid to statistical conclusion and construct validity—which are equally important in making accurate inferences about research findings. This paper also provides a set of practical recommendations in addressing validity concerns when using MTurk.",2-s2.0-84976439423,1,2017,Journal of Business and Psychology,1

Circulating levels of both seasonal and pandemic influenza require constant surveillance to ensure the health and safety of the population. While up-to-date information is critical, traditional surveillance systems can have data availability lags of up to two weeks. We introduce a novel method of estimating, in near-real time, the level of influenza-like illness (ILI) in the United States (US) by monitoring the rate of particular Wikipedia article views on a daily basis. We calculated the number of times certain influenza- or health-related Wikipedia articles were accessed each day between December 2007 and August 2013 and compared these data to official ILI activity levels provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). We developed a Poisson model that accurately estimates the level of ILI activity in the American population, up to two weeks ahead of the CDC, with an absolute average difference between the two estimates of just 0.27% over 294 weeks of data. Wikipedia-derived ILI models performed well through both abnormally high media coverage events (such as during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic) as well as unusually severe influenza seasons (such as the 2012-2013 influenza season). Wikipedia usage accurately estimated the week of peak ILI activity 17% more often than Google Flu Trends data and was often more accurate in its measure of ILI intensity. With further study, this method could potentially be implemented for continuous monitoring of ILI activity in the US and to provide support for traditional influenza surveillance tools.",2-s2.0-84901331477,0,2014,PLoS Computational Biology,1

The users in Online Social Networks (OSN) may share private information with wrong friends. One approach to tackle this issue is by applying community discovery methods in egocentric networks to automatically generate friend circles for the user. There is however a discrepancy between the predicted circles and the circles that the user has in mind. A deep rooted reason is that it only makes sense when the circles are considered under certain usage. We designed and implemented an exploratory visualization tool that can help users determine the visibilities of their online posts. More specifically, we first examined the state-of-the-art community discovery methods for egocentric networks, then proposed a new visualization design with fine-grained control for the user to interact with the circles and make visibility decisions.

Location-based social networks (LBSNs) are a recent phenomenon for sharing a presence at everyday locations with others and have the potential to give new insights into human behaviour. To date, due to barriers in data collection, there has been little research into how our personality relates to the categories of place that we visit. Using the Foursquare LBSN, we have released a web-based participatory application that examines the personality characteristics and checkin behaviour of volunteer Foursquare users. Over a four-month period, we examine the behaviour and the ""Big Five"" personality traits of 174 anonymous users who had collectively checked in 487,396 times at 119,746 venues. Significant correlations are found for Conscientiousness, Openness and Neuroticism. In contrast to some previous findings about online social networks, Conscientiousness is positively correlated with LBSN usage. Openness correlates mainly with location-based variables (average distance between venues visited, venue popularity, number of checkins at sociable venues). For Neuroticism, further negative correlations are found (number of venues visited, number of sociable venues visited). No correlations are found for the other personality traits, which is surprising for Extroversion. The study concludes that personality traits help to explain individual differences in LBSN usage and the type of places visited.",2-s2.0-84921446869,1,2015,Computers in Human Behavior,1

Social relationships between people, e.g., whether they are friends with each other, can be inferred by observing their behaviors in the real world. Thanks to the popularity of GPS-enabled mobile devices or online services, a large amount of high-resolution location data becomes available for such inference studies. However, due to the sensitivity of loca- tion data and user privacy concerns, those studies cannot be largely carried out on individually contributed data without privacy guarantees. Furthermore, we observe that the actual location may not be needed for social relationship studies, but rather the fact that two people met and some statistical properties about their meeting locations, which can be com- puted in a private manner. In this paper, we envision an extensible framework, dubbed Privacy-preserving Location Analytics and Computation Environment (PLACE), which enables social relationship studies by analyzing individually generated location data. PLACE utilizes an untrusted server and computes several building blocks to support various so- cial relationship studies, without disclosing location infor- mation to the server and other untrusted parties. We present PLACE with three example social relationship studies which utilize four privacy-preserving blocks with encryption and differential privacy primitives. The successful realization of PLACE will facilitate private location data acquisition from individual devices, thanks to the strong privacy guarantees, and will enable a wide range of applications.",2-s2.0-84961203044,1,2015,GIS: Proceedings of the ACM International Symposium on Advances in Geographic Information Systems,1

Online social networking communities may exhibit highly complex and adaptive collective behaviors. Since emotions play such an important role in human decision making, how online networks modulate human collective mood states has become a matter of considerable interest. In spite of the increasing societal importance of online social networks, it is unknown whether assortative mixing of psychological states takes place in situations where social ties are mediated solely by online networking services in the absence of physical contact. Here, we show that the general happiness, or subjective well-being (SWB), of Twitter users, as measured from a 6-month record of their individual tweets, is indeed assortative across the Twitter social network. Our results imply that online social networks may be equally subject to the social mechanisms that cause assortative mixing in real social networks and that such assortative mixing takes place at the level of SWB. Given the increasing prevalence of online social networks, their propensity to connect users with similar levels of SWB may be an important factor in how positive and negative sentiments are maintained and spread through human society. Future research may focus on how event-specific mood states can propagate and influence user behavior in ""real life."".",2-s2.0-79960530759,0,2011,Artificial Life,1

In the social sciences, on the other hand, much attention has been devoted to the study of personal networks (PN) which examine the ties an individual has with others and their social characteristics and dynamics. In this paper, we seek to bridge the gap between social and mathematical sciences by exploring how variation in personal network size influences information flow through a complete network. We find that there is a significant negative correlation between a particular combination of personality traits and personal network size.

This paper examines research about Wikipedia that has been undertaken using big data approaches. The aim is to gauge the coherence as against the disparateness of studies from different disciplines, how these studies relate to each other, and to research about Wikipedia and new social media in general. The paper is partly based on interviews with big data researchers, and discusses a number of themes and implications of Wikipedia research, including about the workings of online collaboration, the way that contributions mirror (or not) aspects of real-world geographies, and how contributions can be used to predict offline social and economic trends. Among the findings is that in some areas of research, studies build on and extend each other's results. However, most of the studies stay within disciplinary silos and could be better integrated with other research on Wikipedia and with research about new media. Wikipedia is among few sources in big data research where the data are openly available, unlike many studies where data are proprietary. Thus, it has lent itself to a burgeoning and promising body of research. The paper concludes that in order to fulfil this promise, this research must pay more attention to theories and research from other disciplines, and also go beyond questions based narrowly on the availability of data and towards a more powerful analytical grasp of the phenomenon being investigated.",2-s2.0-84934438044,0,2015,Information Communication and Society,1

To understand the diffusive spreading of a product in a telecom network, whether the product is a service, handset, or subscription, it can be very useful to study the structure of the underlying social network. By combining mobile traffic data and product adoption history from one of Telenor's markets, we can define and measure an adoption network-roughly, the social network of adopters. By studying the time evolution of adoption networks, we can observe how different products diffuses through the network, and measure potential social influence. This paper presents an empirical and comparative study of three adoption networks evolving over time in a large telecom network. We believe that the strongest spreading of adoption takes place in the dense core of the underlying network, and gives rise to a dominant largest connected component (LCC) in the adoption network, which we call ""the social network monster"". We believe that the size of the monster is a good indicator for whether or not a product is taking off. We show that the evolution of the LCC, and the size distribution of the other components, vary strongly with different products. The products studied in this article illustrate three distinct cases: that the social network monsters can grow or break down over time, or fail to occur at all. Some of the reasons a product takes off are intrinsic to the product; there are also aspects of the broader social context that can play in. Tentative explanations are offered for these phenomena. Also, we present two statistical tests which give an indication of the strength of the spreading over the social network. We find evidence that the spreading is dependent on the underlying social network, in particular for the early adopters.",2-s2.0-77958194541,1,2010,"Proceedings - 2010 International Conference on Advances in Social Network Analysis and Mining, ASONAM 2010",1

Understanding and predicting these movements is critical for planning effective humanitarian relief, disaster management, and long-Term societal reconstruction. In this paper, we construct a large human mobility database that stores and manages GPS records from mobile devices used by approximately 1.6 million people throughout Japan from 1 August 2010 to 31 July 2011. By mining this enormous set of Auto-GPS mobile sensor data, the short-Term and longterm evacuation behaviors for individuals throughout Japan during this disaster are able to be automatically discovered. To better understand and simulate human mobility during the disasters, we develop a probabilistic model that is able to be effectively trained by the discovered evacuations via machine learning technique. Based on our training model, population mobility in various cities impacted by the disasters throughout the country is able to be automatically simulated or predicted. On the basis of the whole database, developed model, and experimental results, it is easy for us to find some new features or population mobility patterns after the recent severe earthquake, tsunami and release of radioactivity in Japan, which are likely to play a vital role in future disaster relief and management worldwide.

However, it is expensive and time-consuming to recruit volunteers using traditional approaches. In the Web 2.0 era, abundant and ubiquitous social media data opens a door to the possibility of automatic volunteer identification. In this article, we aim to fully explore this possibility by proposing a scheme that is able to predict users' volunteerism tendency from user-generated contents collected from multiple social networks based on a conceptual volunteering decision model. We conducted comprehensive experiments to investigate the effectiveness of our proposed scheme and further discussed its generalizibility and extendability.

The rise of social network sites reopened the debate on the ability of traditional media to influence public opinion and act as an agenda setter. To answer this question, the present paper investigates first-level and second-level agenda-setting effects in the online environment by focusing on two heated Italian political debates (the reform of public funding of parties and the debate over austerity). By employing innovative and efficient statistical methods such as the lead–lag analysis and supervised sentiment analysis, we compare the attention devoted to each issue and the content spread by online news media and Twitter users. Our results show that online media keep their first-level agenda-setting power even though we find a marked difference between the slant of online news and the Twitter sentiment.",2-s2.0-84966703639,1,2016,Journal of Information Technology and Politics,1

Social community structure is widely utilized in the study of modeling disease propagation, information dissemination and etc. Therefore, detecting the social community structure is one of the most significant tasks for majority of existing works focusing on the online social network. Traditionally, they aim at predicting the existence of social relationships based on cyber interactions (e.g. online conversation) among users. However, the strength information of social relationships is not captured which is as important as the topology information of social communities. Furthermore, physical interactions (e.g., face to face conversation), which have the potential to reflect more realistic state of social relationships than cyber ones, are not taken into account in social relationship measurement. In order to measure the strength of social relationships, in this paper, we propose a hierarchical entropy-based relationship measurement approach (HERMA). HERMA is able to measure the strength of social relationships among users based on their physical interactions which could be inferred by analyzing co-location records extracted from their trajectories. To model users' co-location records in HERMA, a hierarchical region structure is designed. Moreover, two novel concepts called user entropy and area entropy adopted by HERMA are proposed to quantify the activeness degree of an user and the openness degree of an area respectively. Finally, to validate the effectiveness of HERMA, simulations are conducted of which the results show that HERMA outperforms the baselines by leveraging the highest average accuracy on the measurement of social relationships.",2-s2.0-84894039718,1,2014,Journal of Ambient Intelligence and Humanized Computing,1

Complex networks are high abstracts of ubiquitous real complex systems in nature, biology and human society. Motif structures are the basic patterns and important topologies of complex networks even complex systems, and they play roles in classification and analysis of structural properties. In this paper, the connectivity measurement in complex directed networks are discussed based on motif structure. Firstly, the characteristic parameters of motif structure are analysed based on triangular subgraphs existing in the network, and the adjacency matrix is introduced to describe the relationships between adjacent nodes in the motifs. Then, the connecting strengths and the clustering coefficients of directed networks are calculated by the adjacency matrix, so as to measure the importance of the nodes and their connecting edges in both unweighted and weighted directed networks. Finally, the correlation between the motif connecting strengths and traditional connecting strengths are studied as well as between the motif clustering coefficients and traditional clustering coefficients in several typical directed networks, respectively. The results of instance analysis show that the motif measure methods with adjacency matrix, which can comprehensively and conveniently describe the importance of motifs in directed network connections, not only help to improve and expand the traditional connectivity measurements, but also provide a novel thought for the study of complex networks.

Results indicated that none of the enrolled students showed a high level of addiction, although moderate behavioural disorder was found. The multiple linear regression findings displayed that males were more inclined to use the Internet than females, and some students' behaviours were predictors of Internet addiction. Moreover, personality traits such as Agreeableness and Extraversion were negatively related to Internet addiction, whereas Openness was positively associated.

One of the key impediments towards the adoption of opportunistic communications has been the inability to demonstrate viability at scale, namely showing that sufficient opportunities exist and more importantly exist when needed to offer significant network performance gains. We demonstrate through a large-scale, longitudinal study of smartphone users that significant opportunities are indeed prevalent, are indeed stable, and end up being reasonably reciprocal both on short and long-term timescales.

Unlike traditional media, our interactions with political parties via social media are generally public, subject to scrutiny by others and, consequently, a self-presentation concern. This paper contributes to theory on impression management within social network sites (SNSs) by providing an understanding of the effect of visible affiliation on page 'Liking' behavior in the context of political parties; specifically, the possible association with social anxiety and the use of protective impression management. We predict that while users may be motivated to 'Like' a political party, some may feel socially anxious about the impressions their friends may derive from this action, and so ultimately choose to refrain from 'Liking' the party. Furthermore, we propose a new function of 'Secret Likes' (i.e. 'Likes' that others cannot see) as a means to increase gateway interactions. A survey of eligible voters (n = 225) was conducted in the month prior to the 2015 UK general election, examining behavior associated with the Facebook pages of the two largest political parties. Results support that conspicuous affiliation with political parties indeed hinders intention to 'Like' political pages and is associated with social anxiety.

There are a number of unique practices that are inherent to these new online social spaces that extend from the need to maintain a personal profile. For example, many users will regularly update their profiles with new visual or textual information in order to encourage future communication (a practice that will be identified as 'profile changing'). MySpace witnessed a high number of people joining the site in 2005 but more recently there has been similar movement away from the site and towards other online spaces.

Design/methodology/approach: A real-time longitudinal design is used to survey 274 consumers about their information searches when shopping for high involvement goods. Findings: Susceptibility to normative social influence and internet use prove the main drivers of the inclination to resort to the internet to conduct searches using personal information sources. Subjective knowledge also positively impacts the proportion of time spent online conducting searches using personal information sources. Men and consumers with a positive attitude to internet shopping use a greater proportion of impersonal online information sources.

Background: Recently, significant research effort has focused on using Twitter (and other social media) to investigate mental health at the population-level. While there has been influential work in developing ethical guidelines for Internet discussion forum-based research in public health, there is currently limited work focused on addressing ethical problems in Twitter-based public health research, and less still that considers these issues from users' own perspectives. In this work, we aim to investigate public attitudes towards utilizing public domain Twitter data for population-level mental health monitoring using a qualitative methodology. Methods: The study explores user perspectives in a series of five, 2-h focus group interviews. Following a semi-structured protocol, 26 Twitter users with and without a diagnosed history of depression discussed general Twitter use, along with privacy expectations, and ethical issues in using social media for health monitoring, with a particular focus on mental health monitoring. Transcripts were then transcribed, redacted, and coded using a constant comparative approach. Results: While participants expressed a wide range of opinions, there was an overall trend towards a relatively positive view of using public domain Twitter data as a resource for population level mental health monitoring, provided that results are appropriately aggregated. Results are divided into five sections: (1) a profile of respondents' Twitter use patterns and use variability; (2) users' privacy expectations, including expectations regarding data reach and permanence; (3) attitudes towards social media based population-level health monitoring in general, and attitudes towards mental health monitoring in particular; (4) attitudes towards individual versus population-level health monitoring; and (5) users' own recommendations for the appropriate regulation of population-level mental health monitoring.

More importantly, using pornography and sex site usage were sequential mediators in the relationship between Internet addiction and engagement in risky online sexual activities. Moreover, whereas pornography viewing alone was not a predictor of risky online sexual activities, when the behavior escalated to engaging in Internet sex chat sites it did predict engagement in sexting or expectations of offline sex with those known only online.

This paper concern about twitter for political campaign, we take one case in Indonesian legislative elections. In April 2014, Indonesia has held legislative elections. Fifteen political parties have been participated to this election. Each parties has unique strategic for campaign including social media campaign. In this paper we interested with one of political party which very active in social media campaign especially in Twitter, Partai Keadilan Sejahtera (PKS) or Prosperous Justice Party. This party has a lot of supporters and haters are active tweeting on Twitter about the goodness and badness of this party. This thing begs the question that ""Who they are? It is really the voice of Indonesia or just tweets from twitter campaign accounts"". This paper tried to answer above question by presenting the result of analysis with empirical data. We collected all tweets which related with this party and then extract the data and classify to two types of twitter accounts: real and campaign accounts. We use some features and Naïve Bayes as method for classification. We observe the difference between real and campaign accounts in terms of the tweeting behavior and account properties.

In everyday life, we often observe unusually frequent interactions among people before or during important events, i.e., people receive/send more greetings from/to their friends on Christmas Day than regular days. We also observe that some videos suddenly go viral through people's sharing in online social networks (OSNs). Do these seemingly different phenomena share a common structure? All these phenomena are associated with sudden surges of user activities in networks, which we call ""bursts"" in this work. We uncover that the emergence of a burst is accompanied with the formation of triangles in networks. This finding motivates us to propose a new and robust method to detect bursts in OSNs. We first introduce a new measure, ""triadic cardinality distribution"", corresponding to the fractions of nodes with different numbers of triangles, i.e., triadic cardinalities, within a network. We demonstrate that this distribution not only changes when a burst occurs, but it also has a robustness property that it is immunized against common spamming social-bot attacks. Hence, by tracking triadic cardinality distributions, we can reliably detect bursts in OSNs. To avoid handling massive activity data generated by OSN users during the triadic tracking, we design an efficient ""sample-estimate"" solution to provide maximum likelihood estimate on the triadic cardinality distribution from sampled data. Extensive experiments conducted on real data demonstrate the usefulness of this triadic cardinality distribution and effectiveness of our sample-estimate solution.",2-s2.0-84964039168,1,2015,COSN 2015 - Proceedings of the 2015 ACM Conference on Online Social Networks,1

Traditional public health surveillance methods such as those employed by the CDC (United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) rely on regular clinical reports, which are almost always manual and labor intensive. Twitter, a popular micro-blogging service, provides the possibility of automated public health surveillance. Tweets, however, are less than 140 characters, and do not provide sufficient word occurrences for conventional classification methods to work reliably. Moreover, natural language is complex. This makes health-related classification more challenging. In this study, we use flu-related classification as a demonstration to propose a hybrid classification method, which combines two classification approaches: manually- defined features and auto-generated features by machine learning approaches. Preprocessing based on Natural Language Processing (NLP) is used to help extract useful information, and to eliminate noise features.

Most community detection methods use network topology and edge density to identify optimal communities. However, in these methods, several objects that are connected by high weights may be decomposed into different communities, even when they intuitively belong to a single community. In this case, it is more effective to classify the objects into the same community because they perform important roles in controlling and understanding the network. To achieve this goal, in this paper, we propose a method of detecting optimal community structures in a complex network using interaction-based edge clustering. Our approach is to consider network topology as well as interaction density when identifying overlapping and hierarchical communities. Additionally, we measure the differences between the quantity and quality of intra- and inter-community interactions to evaluate the quality of the community structure. We test our method on several benchmark networks with known community structures. Additionally, after applying our method to several real-world complex networks, we evaluate our method through comparison with other methods. We find that the community quality and the overlap quality for our method surpass the results of the other methods.",2-s2.0-84907683285,1,2015,Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications,1

With the advent of ubiquitous sensing and networking, future social networks turn into cyber-physical interactions, which are attached with associated social attributes. Therefore, social network analysis is advancing the interconnections among cyber, physical, and social spaces. Community detection is an important issue in social network analysis. Users in a social network usually have some social interactions with their friends in a community because of their common interests or similar profiles. In this paper, an efficient algorithm of k-clique community detection using formal concept analysis (FCA) - a typical computational intelligence technique, namely, FCA-based k-clique community detection algorithm, is proposed. First, a formal context is constructed from a given social network by a modified adjacency matrix. Second, we define a type of special concept named k-equiconcept, which has the same k-size of extent and intent in a formal concept lattice. Then, we prove that the k-clique detection problem is equivalent to finding the k-equiconcepts. Finally, the efficient algorithms for detecting the k-cliques and k-clique communities are devised by virtue of k-equiconcepts and k-intent concepts, respectively. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm has a higher F-measure value and significantly reduces the computational cost compared with previous works. In addition, a correlation between k and the number of k-clique communities is investigated. Â",2-s2.0-84930458110,1,2015,IEEE Systems Journal,1

Social botnet utilizing online social network (OSN) as Command and Control channel (C&C) has caused enormous threats to Internet security. Server-side detection approaches mainly target on suspicious accounts, which cannot identify the specific bot hosts or processes. Host-side approaches target on suspicious process behaviors which are not robust enough to face the challenges of frequent variants and novel social bots. In this paper, we propose a novel social bot behavior detecting approach in the end host. Because social bot binaries or source codes are not easy to collect, we first design a novel social botnet, named wbbot, based on Sina Weibo. We analyze it from two aspects, wbbot architecture and wbbot behaviors. Second, we analyze the host behaviors of existing social botnets which come from public websites, other researchers, and our implementations. We identify six critical phases: infection, pre-defined host behaviors, establishment of C&C, receive the commands of botmaster, execution of social bot commands, and return the results. Third, we present our detection system which consists of three components: host behavior monitor, host behavior analyzer, and detection approach. We present behavior tree-based approach to detect social bot. After constructing the suspicious behavior tree, we match it with the template library to generate detection result. Finally, we collect real-world social botnet traces to evaluate the performance. We would like to share them for academic research.

Being able to make such categorizations autonomously can significantly strengthen data security, organization, and storage efficiency. In this paper, we analyze several base machine learning based security risk assessment algorithms and develop techniques to improve upon standard algorithms. In particular, we examine labeling document sensitivity, labeling each paragraph in the document with one of three levels of security risk. For evaluation, we use real sensitive texts, from documents leaked by the WikiLeaks organization.

Theory suggests that human behavior has implications for disease spread. We examine the hypothesis that individuals engage in voluntary defensive behavior during an epidemic. We estimate the number of passengers missing previously purchased flights as a function of concern for swine flu or A/H1N1 influenza using 1.7 million detailed flight records, Google Trends, and the World Health Organization's FluNet data. We estimate that concern over ""swine flu,"" as measured by Google Trends, accounted for 0.34% of missed flights during the epidemic. The Google Trends data correlates strongly with media attention, but poorly (at times negatively) with reported cases in FluNet. Passengers show no response to reported cases. Passengers skipping their purchased trips forwent at least $50 M in travel related benefits. Responding to actual cases would have cut this estimate in half. Thus, people appear to respond to an epidemic by voluntarily engaging in self-protection behavior, but this behavior may not be responsive to objective measures of risk. Clearer risk communication could substantially reduce epidemic costs. People undertaking costly risk reduction behavior, for example, forgoing nonrefundable flights, suggests they may also make less costly behavior adjustments to avoid infection. Accounting for defensive behaviors may be important for forecasting epidemics, but linking behavior with epidemics likely requires consideration of risk communication.",2-s2.0-84875183117,0,2013,PLoS ONE,1

The plethora of digital communication technologies, and their mass take up, has resulted in a wealth of interest in social network data collection and analysis in recent years.

In this paper we introduce a class of models for such networks using evolving graphs with memory dependent edges, which may appear and disappear according to their recent history. We consider time discrete and time continuous variants of the model. We consider the long term asymptotic behaviour as a function of parameters controlling the memory dependence. In particular we show that such networks may continue evolving forever, or else may quench and become static (containing immortal and/or extinct edges). This depends on the existence or otherwise of certain infinite products and series involving age dependent model parameters. We show how to differentiate between the alternatives based on a finite set of observations. To test these ideas we show how model parameters may be calibrated based on limited samples of time dependent data, and we apply these concepts to three real networks: summary data on mobile phone use from a developing region; online social-business network data from China; and disaggregated mobile phone communications data from a reality mining experiment in the US.

To estimate the degree to which the inclusion of idioms as features may potentially improve the results of traditional sentiment analysis, we compared our results to two such methods. First, to support idioms as features we collected a set of 580 idioms that are relevant to sentiment analysis, i.e. the ones that can be mapped to an emotion. These mappings were then obtained using a web-based crowdsourcing approach. The quality of the crowdsourced information is demonstrated with high agreement among five independent annotators calculated using Krippendorff's alpha coefficient (α = 0.662). Second, to evaluate the results of sentiment analysis, we assembled a corpus of sentences in which idioms are used in context. Each sentence was annotated with an emotion, which formed the basis for the gold standard used for the comparison against two baseline methods. The performance was evaluated in terms of three measures - precision, recall and F-measure. Overall, our approach achieved 64% and 61% for these three measures in two experiments improving the baseline results by 20 and 15 percent points respectively.

In this paper, we demonstrate our development of two biomedical text mining applications: biomedical literature search (BLS) and biomedical association mining (BAM). While the former requires less computations, the latter is more computationally intensive. Experimental studies were conducted using Amazon Elastic MapReduce (EMR) with an input of 33,960 biomedical articles from TREC (Text REtrieval Conference) 2006 Genomics Track. Our experiment results indicated that both applications’ scalabilities were not linear in term of the number of computing nodes. Meanwhile, BAM achieved better scalability than BLS since BLS performed less computations and were primarily dominated by overheads such as JVM startup, scheduling, disk I/O, etc. These observations imply that existing MapReduce framework may not be suitable for on-line systems such as literature search that needs quick response.",2-s2.0-84962670559,1,2016,Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing,1

Although research in the areas of human mobility and social networks is extensive, our knowledge of the relationship between the mobility and the social network of an individual is very limited, mainly due to the complexity of accessing adequate data to be able to capture both mobility and social interactions. In this paper we present and characterize some of the spatio-temporal features of social networks extracted from a large-scale dataset of cell phone records. Our goal is to measure to which extent individual mobility shapes the characteristics of a social network. Our results show a nontrivial dependence between social network structure and the spatial distribution of its elements. Additionally, we quantify with detail the probability of a contact to be at a certain distance, and find that it may be described in the framework of gravity models, with different decaying rates for urban and interurban scales.",2-s2.0-84873197053,1,2012,"Proceedings - 12th IEEE International Conference on Data Mining Workshops, ICDMW 2012",1

Crowdsourcing has been used widely for the collection of stated preference data (e.g., responses in a survey) by researchers. However, the use of crowdsourcing for collection of revealed preference data (e.g., real-life data collected in natural experiments) is much less common. The study reported in this short (research-in-progress) paper shows how crowdsourcing can be used as a method for the collection of revealed preference data in the context of transport studies. In transport studies, data is traditionally collected through surveys, diaries or simulations. Here, crowdsourcing could provide an alternative method that provides real-life data very fast and very cheap to researchers. To generate insights on crowdsourcing as an alternative data collection method, we use an open call on a crowdsourcing platform (Amazon Mechanical Turk - AMT), a mobile application (Advanced Travel Logging Application for Smartphones II - ATLAS II) and a participant survey to practically perform such a crowdsourced data collection and evaluate the effectiveness of the method. While the full study is still in progress, the initial results reported in this paper are promising and support the idea that crowdsourcing can indeed be used as an effective method for the collection of revealed preference data.",2-s2.0-84990996807,1,2015,"Proceedings - 9th IEEE International Symposium on Service-Oriented System Engineering, IEEE SOSE 2015",1

Purpose - Social media has become an important part of daily interpersonal communication in contemporary society. The purpose of this paper is to explore the attitudes of UK consumers by identifying the hidden information in tweets, and provide a framework which can assist industry practitioners in managing social media data. Design/methodology/approach - Using a large-scale dataset of tweets relating to the Horsemeat scandal of 2013, a comprehensive data analysis framework, which comprises multidimensional scaling and sentiment analysis, alongside other methods, was applied to explore customers' opinions. Findings - Making jokes in social media was a main trend in the tweets relating to Tesco during the Horsemeat scandal. Consumer sentiments were overall negative and burgers were the most mentioned product in the week-long period after the story broke. The posting of tweets was correlated with the timing of news coverage, which indicates that the traditional media is still crucial to public opinion formation. Practical implications - This paper presents a progressive tweet-mining framework that can serve as a tool for academia and practitioners in crisis management. The proposed framework indicates the significant importance of timely categorising the topics, identifying the sentiment of tweets and understanding the changes of consumer opinions over time in a crisis. Originality/value - The research presented in this paper is one of the limited social media research to focus on a UK food fraud issue and adds to the limited body of literature investigating consumer social media use from the side of industry practitioners.",2-s2.0-84976584147,1,2016,Industrial Management and Data Systems,1

Author profiling is the identification of demographic features of an author by examining his written text. Recently, it has attracted the attention of research community due to it's potential applications in forensic, security, marketing, fake profiles identification on online social networking sites, capturing sender of harassing messages etc. We need benchmark corpora to develop and evaluate techniques for author profiling. Majority of the existing corpora are for English and other European languages but not for under–resourced South Asian languages, like Roman Urdu (written using English alphabets). Roman Urdu is used in daily communication by a large number of native speakers of Urdu around the world particularly in Facebook posts/comments, Twitter tweets, blogs, chat blogs and SMS messaging. The construction of sentences of Urdu while using alphabets of English transforms the language properties of the text. We aim to investigate the behavior of existing author profiling techniques for multilingual text consisting of English and Roman Urdu, concretely for gender and age identification. We here focus on author profiling on Facebook by (i) developing a multilingual (Roman Urdu and English) corpus, (ii) manually building of a bilingual dictionary for translating Roman Urdu words into English, (iii) modeling existing state-of-the-art author profiling techniques by using content based features (word and character N–grams) and 64 different stylistic based features (11 lexical word based features, 47 lexical character based features and 6 vocabulary richness measures) for age and gender identification on multilingual and translated corpora, (iv) evaluating and comparing the behavior of above mentioned techniques on multilingual and translated corpora. Our extensive empirical evaluation shows that (i) existing author profiling techniques can be used for multilingual text (Roman Urdu + English) as well as monolingual text (corpus obtained after translating multilingual corpus using bilingual dictionary), (ii) content based methods outperform stylistic based methods for both gender and age identification task and (iii) translation of multilingual corpus to monolingual text does not improve results.",2-s2.0-85017404586,0,2017,Information Processing and Management,1

Adopting the O-S-R-O-R (Orientation–Stimulus–Reasoning–Orientation–Response) model of political communication effects, this study examined the roles of Facebook network size, connections with public political actors, use for news, and political expression on political attitudes, protest, and participation. Structural equation analyses were conducted based on data from a national sample in Hong Kong, a city-state with one of the world’s highest Facebook penetration rates. Results showed that Facebook network size and connections with public political actors exhibit both direct and indirect effects on participation through Facebook news, expression, and efficacy.

Theories suggest that the effectiveness of responses depends on the type of accusation, yet online research indicates that apologies are superior to denials regardless of the type of accusation. We argue that customers are suspicious about online sellers, making denials implausible and ineffective in rebuilding trust. A good reputation may mitigate suspicion, making denials more believable and restoring trust.

First, a general shift to data-intensive science will exert an influence on all scientific disciplines, but particularly on the behavioral and social sciences given the wealth of behavior and related constructs captured by big data sources. Second, science is itself a social enterprise; by applying principles from the social sciences to the conduct of research, it should be possible to ameliorate some of the systemic problems that plague the scientific enterprise in the age of big data.

The related social network models are usually used for simulating and validating real social systems by using simulation data. But most of these social network models are built on existing nodes to study their edge statistical characteristics, such as degree distribution, clustering coefficient, community structure and etc., little consideration of evolutionary dynamics of social networks are involved, which are the physical base of various social networks and also an important research topic. In this paper, we consider one issue that what kind of factors is beneficial or harmful to the growth of nodes in a social network. Cellular automaton model is applied in this paper to attempt to study this issue, which can be seen as an evolutionary dynamics of a social network. Three kinds of factors named selfishness, reciprocity, and altruism, which are essential for constructing a social network, are introduced in the paper to analyse how they affect the growth of the virtual social network. A conclusion is obtained that reciprocity and altruism promote growth of nodes in the social network, on the other hand, selfishness inhibits the growth.

Maintaining data availability is one of the biggest challenges in Decentralized Online Social Networks (DOSN). In the existing work of improving data availability in DOSN, it is often assumed that the friends of a user are always capable of contributing sufficient storage capacity to store all the data published by the user. However, this assumption is not always true for today's Online Social Networks (OSNs) for the following reasons. On one hand, the increasingly more data are being generated on the OSNs nowadays. On the other hand, current users often use the smart mobile devices to access the OSNs. These two factors cause the shortage of the storage capacity in DOSN, where the published data are supposed to be stored within a friend circle. The limitation of the storage capacity may jeopardize the data availability. Therefore, it is desired to know the relation between the storage capacity contributed by the OSN users and the level of data availability that the OSN can achieve. This paper addresses this issue. In this paper, the data availability model over storage capacity is established. Further, a novel method is proposed to predict the data availability on the fly. Extensive simulation experiments have been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the data availability model and the on-the-fly prediction. The data availability model can be used by the OSN designers to determine the storage capacity for the published data in order to achieve the desired data availability. The on-the-fly prediction method can help the data replication and storage policies make judicious decisions at runtime.",2-s2.0-84926167150,1,2014,"Proceedings - 2014 IEEE International Conference on Web Services, ICWS 2014",1

Such Human-Machine Networks (HMNs) are embedded in the daily lives of people, both for personal and professional use. They can have a significant impact by producing synergy and innovations. The challenge in designing successful HMNs is that they cannot be developed and implemented in the same manner as networks of machines nodes alone, or following a wholly human-centric view of the network. The problem requires an interdisciplinary approach. Here, we review current research of relevance to HMNs across many disciplines. Extending the previous theoretical concepts of sociotechnical systems, actor-network theory, cyber-physical-social systems, and social machines, we concentrate on the interactions among humans and between humans and machines. We identify eight types of HMNs: public-resource computing, crowdsourcing, web search engines, crowdsensing, online markets, social media, multiplayer online games and virtual worlds, and mass collaboration. We systematically select literature on each of these types and review it with a focus on implications for designing HMNs.

A survey of 202 Facebook users aged 16-65 years was conducted using a 79-question online survey to examine users' emotion and behaviour (state anxiety, trait anxiety, and severity of depression) when their ex-partners reappeared on social networking sites (SNS), they received an invitation from an ex-partner to be friends on SNS, and when they saw pictures of ex-partners with current girlfriends or boyfriends. The results indicated that for people who accepted former partners' invitation to be Facebook friends, trait anxiety was more pronounced than for those who did not. Moreover, people who accepted former partners' invitations to become Facebook friends were much more depressed than those who did not. In addition, it is found that gender generates significant differences in the severity of depression. It is worth noting that when people met former partners on Facebook, men were much more depressed than women. However, the way in which participants broke up with ex-partners did not significantly affect their state anxiety, trait anxiety, or the severity of depression. Finally, the participants' cognition of and importance placed on their former relationship resulted in significant differences in trait anxiety. The current study adds to the growing body of literature investigating relationships among SNS users, becoming friends with ex-partners on Facebook, emotions, and behaviour.",2-s2.0-84929607025,1,2015,Behaviour and Information Technology,1

This paper proposes a design for a gamified crowdsourcing workflow to extract annotation from medical text. Developed in the context of a general crowdsourcing platform, Dr. Detective is a game with a purpose that engages medical experts into solving annotation tasks on medical case reports, tailored to capture disagreement between annotators. It incorporates incentives such as learning features, to motivate a continuous involvement of the expert crowd. The game was designed to identify expressions valuable for training NLP tools, and interpret their relation in the context of medical diagnosing. In this way, we can resolve the main problem in gathering ground truth from experts - that the low inter-annotator agreement is typically caused by different interpretations of the text. We report on the results of a pilot study assessing the usefulness of this game. The results show that the quality of the annotations by the expert crowd are comparable to those of an NLP parser. Furthermore, we observed that allowing game users to access each others' answers increases agreement between annotators.",2-s2.0-84923882840,0,2013,CEUR Workshop Proceedings,1

We examine the relation between psychopathy, especially its fearless dominance dimension, and heroism in two undergraduate samples (N=. 124 and 119), a community sample (N=. 457) and 42 U.S. presidents. The first undergraduate and community sample revealed significant positive correlations between fearless dominance and heroism and altruism toward strangers; the presidential sample provided some evidence for an association between fearless dominance and war heroism. In the second undergraduate sample, fearless dominance was related only to altruism toward strangers; heroism was instead significantly positively correlated with the impulsive antisociality component of psychopathy. These findings raise the possibility that some psychopathic personality traits are modestly associated with heightened levels of heroic altruism, and raise questions for future research on the personality correlates of heroism.",2-s2.0-84879774777,1,2013,Journal of Research in Personality,1

This study investigates the question of Internet mode effects in online election studies. Specifically, we examine whether Web versions of election studies can produce more accurate or truthful estimates of vote choice and party preference than their more conventional offline counterparts. Existing studies have indicated that a Web environment may lower the social context of the survey, promoting greater openness from respondents in answers on political preference items. We examine this question using data from the 2001 Australian Election Study (AES) in which a Web and mail survey were conducted. Crucially, both online and offline questionnaires relied on self-completion, a standardization lacking in previous studies and that allowed for a more controlled test of mode effects. The results reveal no significant differences in the expression of political preferences across the two surveys after controlling for key demographic and attitudinal factors. Significant differences do emerge, however, in vote choice depending on whether an individual had Internet access. We conclude that while Web mode per se does not have any notable effect on respondents' answers to political choice questions, until the issue of universal access is resolved, its substitution for existing methods would be undesirable as this would exclude an important and politically distinctive subset of the population.",2-s2.0-70449120583,1,2009,Journal of Political Marketing,1

182,10630,"Rand D.G., Arbesman S., Christakis N.A.",Dynamic social networks promote cooperation in experiments with humans,"Dynamic social networks promote cooperation in experiments with humans. Human populations are both highly cooperative and highly organized. Human interactions are not random but rather are structured in social networks. Importantly, ties in these networks often are dynamic, changing in response to the behavior of one's social partners. This dynamic structure permits an important form of conditional action that has been explored theoretically but has received little empirical attention: People can respond to the cooperation and defection of those around them by making or breaking network links. Here, we present experimental evidence of the power of using strategic link formation and dissolution, and the network modification it entails, to stabilize cooperation in sizable groups. Our experiments explore large-scale cooperation, where subjects' cooperative actions are equally beneficial to all those with whom they interact. Consistent with previous research, we find that cooperation decays over time when social networks are shuffled randomly every round or are fixed across all rounds. We also find that, when networks are dynamic but are updated only infrequently, cooperation again fails. However, when subjects can update their network connections frequently, we see a qualitatively different outcome: Cooperation is maintained at a high level through network rewiring. Subjects preferentially break links with defectors and form new links with cooperators, creating an incentive to cooperate and leading to substantial changes in network structure. Our experiments confirm the predictions of a set of evolutionary game theoretic models and demonstrate the important role that dynamic social networks can play in supporting large-scale human cooperation.",2-s2.0-82755198505,1,2011,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,1

Many Americans sought information on ""voter registration"" even after the deadline in their state had passed. Combining web search data with evidence on the timing of registration for 80 million Americans, we model the relationship between search and registration. Extrapolating this relationship to the post-deadline period, we estimate that an additional 3-4 million Americans would have registered in time to vote, if deadlines had been extended to Election Day.

We have explored this question experimentally by artificially inverting the true popularity of songs in an online ""music market,"" in which 12,207 participants listened to and downloaded songs by unknown bands. We found that most songs experienced self-fulfilling prophecies, in which perceived - but initially false - popularity became real over time. We also found, however, that the inversion was not self-fulfilling for the market as a whole, in part because the very best songs recovered their popularity in the long run. Moreover, the distortion of market information reduced the correlation between appeal and popularity, and led to fewer overall downloads.

Sampling 515 college students, this study investigates how privacy protection, including profile visibility, self-disclosure, and friending, are influenced by privacy concerns and efficacy regarding one's own ability to manage privacy settings, a factor that researchers have yet to give a great deal of attention to in the context of social networking sites (SNSs). The results of this study indicate an inconsistency in adopting strategies to protect privacy, a disconnect from limiting profile visibility and friending to self-disclosure. More specifically, privacy concerns lead SNS users to limit their profile visibility and discourage them from expanding their network. However, they do not constrain self-disclosure. Similarly, while self-efficacy in privacy management encourages SNS users to limit their profile visibility, it facilitates self-disclosure. This suggests that if users are limiting their profile visibility and constraining their friending behaviors, it does not necessarily mean they will reduce self-disclosure on SNSs because these behaviors are predicted by different factors. In addition, the study finds an interaction effect between privacy concerns and self-efficacy in privacy management on friending. It points to the potential problem of increased risk-taking behaviors resulting from high self-efficacy in privacy management and low privacy concerns.",2-s2.0-84921031353,1,2015,"Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking",1

Thus, this study used a U.S. representative sample to test the privacy calculus' generalizability and extend its theoretical framework by including both self-withdrawal behaviors and privacy self-efficacy. Results confirmed the extended privacy calculus model. Moreover, both privacy concerns and privacy self-efficacy positively predicted use of self-withdrawal.

Ever since first mobile phones equipped with Global Position System (GPS) came to the market, knowing the exact user location has become a holy grail of almost every service that lives in the digital world. Starting with the idea of location based services, nowadays it is not only important to know where users are in real time, but also to be able predict where they will be in future. Moreover, it is not enough to know user location in form of latitude longitude coordinates provided by GPS devices, but also to give a place its meaning (i.e., semantically label it), in particular detecting the most probable home location for the given user. The aim of this paper is to provide novel insights on differences among the ways how different types of human digital trails represent the actual mobility patterns and therefore the differences between the approaches interpreting those trails for inferring said patterns. Namely, with the emergence of different digital sources that provide information about user mobility, it is of vital importance to fully understand that not all of them capture exactly the same picture. With that being said, in this paper we start from an example showing how human mobility patterns described by means of radius of gyration are different for Flickr social network and dataset of bank card transactions. Rather than capturing human movements closer to their homes, Flickr more often reveals people travel mode. Consequently, home location inferring methods used in both cases cannot be the same. We consider several methods for home location definition known from the literature and demonstrate that although for bank card transactions they provide highly consistent results, home location definition detection methods applied to Flickr dataset happen to be way more sensitive to the method selected, stressing the paramount importance of adjusting the method to the specific dataset being used.",2-s2.0-84951875234,1,2015,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),1

Despite the steady growth of e-commerce communities in the past two decades, little has changed in the way these communities manage reputation for building trust and for protecting their member's financial interests against fraud. As these communities mature and the defects of their reputation systems are revealed, further potential for deception against their members is created, that pushes the need for novel reputation mechanisms. Although a high volume of research works has explored the concepts of reputation and trust in e-communities, most of the proposed reputation systems target decentralized e-communities, focusing on issues related with the decentralized reputationmanagement; they have not thus been integrated in e-commerce platforms. This work's objective is to provide an attackresilient feedback-based reputation system for modern e-commerce platforms, while minimizing the incurred financial burden of potent security schemes.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to present competing risks models and show how dwell times can be applied to predict users’ online behavior. This information enables real-time personalization of web content. Design/methodology/approach: This paper models transitions between pages based upon the dwell time of the initial state and then analyzes data from a web shop, illustrating how pages that are linked “compete” against each other. Relative risks for web page transitions are estimated based on the dwell time within a clickstream and survival analysis is used to predict clickstreams. Findings: Using survival analysis and user dwell times allows for a detailed examination of transition behavior over time for different subgroups of internet users. Differences between buyers and non-buyers are shown. Research limitations/implications: As opposed to other academic fields, survival analysis has only infrequently been used in internet-related research. This paper illustrates how a novel application of this method yields interesting insights into internet users’ online behavior. Practical implications: A key goal of any online retailer is to increase their customer conversation rates. Using survival analysis, this paper shows how dwell-time information, which can be easily extracted from any server log file, can be used to predict user behavior in real time. Companies can apply this information to design websites that dynamically adjust to assumed user behavior. Originality/value: The method shows novel clickstream analysis not previously demonstrated.

While studies have found that misconceptions about IUDs are prevalent, few have examined the influence of women's social networks on perceptions of the method. Methods: Twenty-four interviews and three focus groups (comprising 14 participants) were conducted in 2013 with a diverse sample of women aged 15-45 recruited from family planning clinics and the community in San Francisco. Half of participants had used IUDs. Women were asked about their social communication concerning contraceptives, particularly IUDs, and about the content of the information they had received or given. Transcripts were analyzed using a modified grounded theory approach to identify themes of interest. Results: Women reported that communication with female friends and family members was a valued means ofobtaining information about contraceptives, and that negative information (which often was incorrect) was more prevalent and memorable than positive information in such communication. Women heard about negative experiences with IUDs from social contacts and television commercials; clinicians were a major source of positive information. Women who had never used IUDs expressed interest in learning about potential side effects and how IUDs feel, while users reported emphasizing to friends and family the method's efficacy and ease of use. Conclusions: Misinformation and negative information about IUDs are prevalent in social communication, and the information transmitted through social networks differs from the information never-users wish to receive. Findings support the creation of peer-led interventions to encourage IUD users to share positive personal experiences and evidence-based information.",2-s2.0-84909578452,0,2014,Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health,1

Sarcasm is a form of communication that is intended to mock or harass someone by using words with the opposite of their literal meaning. However, identification of sarcasm is somewhat difficult due to the gap between its literal and intended meaning. Recognition of sarcasm is a task that can potentially provide a lot of benefits to other areas of natural language processing. In this research, we propose a new method to identify sarcasm in tweets that focuses on several approaches: 1) sentiment analysis, 2) concept level and common-sense knowledge 3) coherence and 4) machine learning classification. We will use support vector machine (SVM) to classify sarcastic tweet based on our proposed features as well as ordinary N-grams. Our proposed classifier is an ensemble of two SVMs with two different feature sets. The results of the experiment show our method outperforms the baseline method and achieves 80% accuracy.

It is commonly believed that information spreads between individuals like a pathogen, with each exposure by an informed friend potentially resulting in a naive individual becoming infected. However, empirical studies of social media suggest that individual response to repeated exposure to information is far more complex. As a proxy for intervention experiments, we compare user responses to multiple exposures on two different social media sites, Twitter and Digg. We show that the position of exposing messages on the user-interface strongly affects social contagion. Accounting for this visibility significantly simplifies the dynamics of social contagion. The likelihood an individual will spread information increases monotonically with exposure, while explicit feedback about how many friends have previously spread it increases the likelihood of a response. We provide a framework for unifying information visibility, divided attention, and explicit social feedback to predict the temporal dynamics of user behavior.",2-s2.0-84896350232,0,2014,Scientific Reports,1

In crowdsourced map services, digital maps are created and updated manually by volunteered users. Existing service providers usually provide users with a feature-rich map editor to add, drop, and modify roads. To make the map data more useful for widely-used applications such as navigation systems and travel planning services, it is important to provide not only the topology of the road network and the shapes of the roads, but also the types of each road segment (e.g., highway, regular road, secondary way, etc.). To reduce the cost of manual map editing, it is desirable to generate proper recommendations for users to choose from or conduct further modifications. There are several recent works aimed at generating road shapes from large number of historical trajectories; while to the best of our knowledge, none of the existing works have addressed the problem of inferring road types from historical trajectories. In this paper, we propose a model-based approach to infer road types from taxis trajectories. We use a combined inference method based on stacked generalization, taking into account both the topology of the road network and the historical trajectories.

With the pervasiveness of mobile Internet, much evidence shows that human mobility has heavy impact on app usage behavior. However, the relationship between them has not been quantified in any form. In this article, a rating framework is presented to demonstrate the existence of their connection. The core idea of a rating framework selects the most significant mobility features that may influence app usage behavior. In particular, we focus on three aspects of human mobility in urban areas: individual mobility characteristics, location, and travel behavior, from both the crowd and individual points of view.

This study examines the effects of online partisan news on intention to engage in two online discussion dimensions: withdrawal and civil discussion. The novel notion of internal balance is advanced to determine the degree of balance or lack thereof (partisanship) within news stories. The effects are tested in two traditionally different media systems, the United States and Spain, using a controlled experiment. Results demonstrate that partisan news leads to less withdrawal and more civil discussion intention compared to balanced news.

Complex network has become an important way to analyze the massive disordered information of complex systems, and its community structure property is indispensable to discover the potential functionality of these systems. The research on uncovering the community structure of networks has attracted great attentions from various fields in recent years. Many community detection approaches have been proposed based on the modularity optimization. Among them, the algorithms which optimize one initial solution to a better one are easy to get into local optima. Moreover, the algorithms which are susceptible to the optimized order are easy to obtain unstable solutions. In addition, the algorithms which simultaneously optimize a population of solutions have high computational complexity, and thus they are difficult to apply to practical problems. To solve the above problems, in this study, we propose a fast memetic algorithm with multi-level learning strategies for community detection by optimizing modularity. The proposed algorithm adopts genetic algorithm to optimize a population of solutions and uses the proposed multi-level learning strategies to accelerate the optimization process. The multi-level learning strategies are devised based on the potential knowledge of the node, community and partition structures of networks, and they work on the network at nodes, communities and network partitions levels, respectively. Extensive experiments on both benchmarks and real-world networks demonstrate that compared with the state-of-the-art community detection algorithms, the proposed algorithm has effective performance on discovering the community structure of networks.",2-s2.0-84896754758,1,2014,Applied Soft Computing Journal,1

The value of subjective content available in Social Media has boosted the importance of Sentiment Analysis on this kind of scenario. However, performing Sentiment Analysis on Social Media is a challenging task, since the huge volume of short textual posts and high dynamicity inherent to it pose strict requirements of efficiency and scalability. Despite all efforts, the literature still lacks proposals that address both requirements. In this sense, we propose LEGi, a corpus-based method for consolidating context-aware sentiment lexicons. It is based on a semi-supervised strategy for propagation of lexicon-semantic classes on a transition graph of terms. Empirical analyses on two distinct domains, derived from Twitter, demonstrate that LEGi outperformed four well-established methods for lexicon consolidation. Further, we found that LEGi's lexicons may improve the quality of the sentiment analysis performed by a traditional method in the literature. Thus, our results point out LEGi as a promising method for consolidating lexicons in high demanding scenarios, such as Social Media.

Thus, young people are exposed to and display pro-alcohol messages and images through online portrayals of drinking on personal pages as well as unregulated alcohol marketing on social media sites that may reach underage people. Such online displays of alcohol behavior have been correlated with offline alcohol behavior and risky drinking. Health behavior theories have been used to describe the influence of social media sites, including Social Learning Theory, the Media Practice Model, and a more recent conceptual approach called the Facebook Influence Model. Researchers are beginning to assess the potential of social media sites in identifying high-risk drinkers through online display patterns as well as delivering prevention messages and interventions.

Due to the large data volume and privacy concern, it is infeasible to obtain global network information for every OSN. We propose a decentralized framework, named REPULSE, to predict whether a target user will retweet a message relayed by his friends. We also identify a new set of communityrelated features that improve retweet prediction accuracy considerably. To demonstrate the value of community-related features, we propose another framework named HOTPIE to predict tweets popularity. Utilizing community-related features can boost the F1 score of popularity prediction from 0.43 to 0.55.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to propose a method to detect local events in real time using Twitter, an online microblogging platform. The authors especially aim at detecting local events regardless of the type and scale. Design/methodology/approach - The method is based on the observation that relevant tweets (Twitter posts) are simultaneously posted from the place where a local event is happening. Specifically, the method first extracts the place where and the time when multiple tweets are posted using a hierarchical clustering technique. It next detects the co-occurrences of key terms in each spatiotemporal cluster to find local events. To determine key terms, it computes the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TFIDF) scores based on the spatiotemporal locality of tweets. Findings - From the experimental results using geotagged tweet data between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m. on October 9, 2011, the method significantly improved the precision of between 50 and 100 per cent at the same recall compared to a baseline method. Originality/value - In contrast to existing work, the method described in this paper can detect various types of small-scale local events as well as large-scale ones by incorporating the spatiotemporal feature of tweet postings and the text relevance of tweets.

A fundamental open question in the analysis of social networks was to understand the evolution between similarity and group social ties. In general, two groups are similar for two distinct reasons: first, they grow to change their behaviors to the same group due to social influence; second, they tend to merge a group due to similar behaviors, where a process often is termed selection by sociologists. It was important to understand why two groups could merge and what led to high similarities for members in a group, influence or selection. In this paper, the techniques for identifying and modeling interactions between social influence and selection for different groups were developed. Different similarities were computed in three phases where groups came into being, before or after according to the number of common edits in Wikipedia. Experimental results showed selection played a more important role in two group merging. Copyright",2-s2.0-85009517382,1,2016,Journal of Donghua University (English Edition),1

Our vulnerability model is based upon a way to quantify the vulnerability of a profile and consists of three components. The individual vulnerability is determined by the presence of values for the profile attributes which may contribute towards the composite personal vulnerability via a weight based system. The relative vulnerability indicates the contribution of collective vulnerability of the profile's friends, whereas the absolute vulnerability is the overall composite vulnerability for the profile by considering the contributions of the individual and relative vulnerabilities.

Social media measurement relies heavily on self-report survey research. Hence, known biases in how individuals answer survey questions can introduce systematic errors into the social media literature. In particular, many common social media measures are prone to acquiescence response bias, an error that occurs due to individuals' tendency to agree with agree-disagree questions. The current study tests a series of techniques to both detect and overcome acquiescence bias in the context of Facebook measurement. Controlling for individuals' tendency to agree with agree-disagree questions, we find evidence that acquiescence has inflated the reliabilities and factor loadings of many Facebook use scales, and has altered correlations both among Facebook use measures and between those measures and related covariates. Further, when the individual-level tendency to agree with questions is controlled, Facebook measures demonstrate greater criterion validity in their relations to items that do not use agree-disagree scales. Having identified the presence of acquiescent responding, we test three methods for mitigating this response bias: the use of balanced scales, item-specific questions, and statistical correctives. All three methods appear to reduce the bias introduced by acquiescence. Thus, the results provide comparative evidence on strategies to alleviate the consistent impact of an important method bias in social media measurement and thereby contribute to improving the validity of social media research at large.",2-s2.0-84957603551,1,2016,Computers in Human Behavior,1

We develop an algorithm that extracts such changes from streaming data and discover that a large number of social media accounts are performing synchronous and collaborative URL changes. We identify various types of URL changes such as handover, exchange, serial handover and loop exchange. All such behaviors are likely to be automated behavior and, thus, indicate accounts that are either already involved in malicious activities or being prepared to do so.

We identify that URL handovers are instantaneous automated operations. We further investigate to understand the benefits of URL handovers, and identify that handovers are strongly associated with reusable internal links and successful avoidance of suspension by the host site.

In contrast, for users that are more selective and have fewer Facebook friends, all three aforementioned tie strength measures correlate with trust. Our findings are preliminary evidence that traditional measures of dyadic trust like embeddedness which are used widely in physical-world social networks may not always be effective predictors of digital trust, because not all online social ties are created equal. Our findings provide preliminary evidence that traditional measures of dyadic trust may not always be effective predictors of trust, as not all online social ies are created equal.",2-s2.0-85016291352,1,2017,MIS Quarterly: Management Information Systems,1

Sentiment analysis or opinion mining is a deterministic technique for classifying and evaluating other people's opinions. Nowadays, people build their perception and make decisions by analysing the facts and reviews of other people either manually or computationally. Since everything is online nowadays, internet has become an integrated part of human lives and is thus used for exchanging all aspects of human life viz. sentiments, emotions, affection, support, opinions, trade, business, etc. With the onset of social media there has been numerous platform such as blogs, discussion forums, reviews and social networks where an individual can post his or her reviews, feedbacks and list their likes and dislikes for a product's attributes or features or comparison of different products (same or different feature). These reviews are gathered and are analysed to evaluate the overall orientation of the collected reviews. This survey paper focuses on in-depth study of the topic and discusses all concepts and terminologies of opinion mining. This paper also discusses the methods and techniques used for gathering reviews, extracting the phrases based on the subjectivity (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006) and thereafter calculating the semantic orientation of the collected reviews.",2-s2.0-84989899365,1,2016,International Journal of Data Analysis Techniques and Strategies,1

The increasing popularity of the social networking service, Twitter, has made it more involved in day-to-day communications, strengthening social relationships and information dissemination. Conversations on Twitter are now being explored as indicators within early warning systems to alert of imminent natural disasters such as earthquakes and aid prompt emergency responses to crime. Producers are privileged to have limitless access to market perception from consumer comments on social media and microblogs. Targeted advertising can be made more effective based on user profile information such as demography, interests and location. While these applications have proven beneficial, the ability to effectively infer the location of Twitter users has even more immense value. However, accurately identifying where a message originated from or an author's location remains a challenge, thus essentially driving research in that regard. In this paper, we survey a range of techniques applied to infer the location of Twitter users from inception to state of the art.

We track online communication around these protests for the period of one month, and reconstruct the network of mentions and re-tweets according to the search and the streaming APIs, and to different filtering parameters. We find that smaller samples do not offer an accurate picture of peripheral activity; we also find that the bias is greater for the network of mentions, partly because of the higher influence of snowballing in identifying relevant nodes.

Thanks to widely available, cheap Internet access and the ubiquity of smartphones, millions of people around the world now use online location-based social networking services. Understanding the structural properties of these systems and their dependence upon users' habits and mobility has many potential applications, including resource recommendation and link prediction. Here, we construct and characterise social and place-focused graphs by using longitudinal information about declared social relationships and about users' visits to physical places collected from a popular online location-based social service. We show that although the social and place-focused graphs are constructed from the same data set, they have quite different structural properties.We find that the social and location-focused graphs have different global and meso-scale structure, and in particular that social and place-focused communities have negligible overlap. Consequently, group inference based on community detection performed on the social graph alone fails to isolate place-focused groups, even though these do exist in the network. By studying the evolution of tie structure within communities, we show that the time period over which location data are aggregated has a substantial impact on the stability of place-focused communities, and that information about place-based groups may be more useful for user-centric applications than that obtained from the analysis of social communities alone.",2-s2.0-84898052708,0,2013,European Physical Journal B,1

Studying the evolution of this network allows the discovery of emerging social structures and their growth trends. In this paper, we demonstrate the advantages of using the self-organizing maps (SOM) to visualize the evolution of a social network formed by a set of blogs, from their beginning to their current state. By observing the position a weblog is mapped to, it is easy to see what communities it belongs to nowadays, and how and when it became a part of those communities. The proposed procedure gives some insight on how communities are formed and have evolved.

Background: Traditional metrics of the impact of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and health insurance marketplaces in the United States include public opinion polls and marketplace enrollment, which are published with a lag of weeks to months. In this rapidly changing environment, a real-time barometer of public opinion with a mechanism to identify emerging issues would be valuable. Objective: We sought to evaluate Twitter's role as a real-time barometer of public sentiment on the ACA and to determine if Twitter sentiment (the positivity or negativity of tweets) could be predictive of state-level marketplace enrollment. Methods: We retrospectively collected 977,303 ACA-related tweets in March 2014 and then tested a correlation of Twitter sentiment with marketplace enrollment by state. Results: A 0.10 increase in the sentiment score was associated with an 8.7% increase in enrollment at the state level (95% CI 1.32-16.13; P=.02), a correlation that remained significant when adjusting for state Medicaid expansion (P=.02) or use of a state-based marketplace (P=.03). Conclusions: This correlation indicates Twitter's potential as a real-time monitoring strategy for future marketplace enrollment periods; marketplaces could systematically track Twitter sentiment to more rapidly identify enrollment changes and potentially emerging issues.

We address this question here by measuring the correlation between the returns of 27 publicly traded companies and news about them as collected from Yahoo Financial News for the period 1 Oct 2014 to 30 Apr 2015. In all reported experiments, two metrics are defined, one to measure the distance between two time series, the other to quantify the difference between two collections of news items. Two 27 × 27 distance matrices are thus produced, and their correlation measured with the Mantel test. This allows us to estimate the correlation of stock market data (returns, change, volume and close price) with the content of published news in a given period of time.

While the majority of current social media research deals with active user analysis, there is very little work in understanding the dynamics of passive consumers and their influence. Our global scale Internet measurement of user access patterns of a diverse set of Internet media services indicates conclusively that majority of consumers are passive. In this paper, we develop a spatio-temporal mathematical model and the corresponding stochastic analysis to understand the passive consumer dynamics. Both discrete and continuous time analysis are presented. We also show how the analysis can be used to identify spatial points of influence, i.e., spatial locations that have maximum expertise or influence on a topic. The analysis takes into account, the initial level of consumption at each spatial location and the influence of different passive consumers at different geographic locations on each other. The effect of information noise is taken into account to derive fundamental limits of passive information consumption. Theoretical results are verified using real Internet measurement data.

AbstractAlthough influenza has been associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations, it is not clear the extent to which this association affects healthcare use in the United States. The first goal of this project was to determine to what extent the incidence of COPD hospitalizations is associated with seasonal influenza. Second, as a natural experiment, we used influenza activity to help predict COPD admissions during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. To do this, we identified all hospitalizations between 1998 and 2010 in the Nationwide Inpatient Sample from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) during which a primary diagnosis of COPD was recorded. Separately, we identified all hospitalizations during which a diagnosis of influenza was recorded. We formulated time series regression models to investigate the association of monthly COPD admissions with influenza incidence. Finally, we applied these models, fit using 1998-2008 data, to forecast monthly COPD admissions during the 2009 pandemic. Based on time series regression models, a strong, significant association exists between concurrent influenza activity and incidence of COPD hospitalizations (p-value < 0.0001). The association is especially strong among older patients requiring mechanical ventilation. Use of influenza data to predict COPD admissions during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic reduced the mean-squared prediction error by 29.9%. We conclude that influenza activity is significantly associated with COPD hospitalizations in the United States and influenza activity can be exploited to more accurately forecast COPD admissions. Our results suggest that improvements in influenza surveillance, prevention, and treatment may decrease hospitalizations of patients diagnosed with COPD.",2-s2.0-84884549524,1,2013,COPD: Journal of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease,1

In recent years, there has been a rapid growth of research interest in natural language processing that seeks to better understand sentiment or opinion expressed in text. There are several notable issues in most previous work in sentiment analysis, among them: the trained classifiers are domain-dependent; the labeled corpora required for training can be difficult to acquire from real-world text; and dependencies between sentiments and topics are not taken into consideration. In response to these limitations, a new family of probabilistic topic models, namely joint sentiment-topic models, have been developed, which are capable of detecting sentiment in connection with topic from text without using any labeled data for training. In addition, the sentiment-bearing topics extracted by the joint sentiment-topic models provide means for automatically discovering and summarizing opinions from a vast amount of user-generated data.",2-s2.0-84939224425,1,2015,Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,1

Purpose: Previous research in offline environments suggests that there may be an overlap in bullying and sexual harassment perpetration and victimization; however to what extent this may be true for perpetration and victimization of Internet harassment and unwanted sexual solicitation is unknown. Methods: The Growing Up with Media survey is a national cross-sectional online survey of 1,588 youth, 10-15 years old, who have used the Internet at least once in the last 6 months. Cluster analysis was conducted with four scales: Internet harassment perpetration, Internet harassment victimization, unwanted sexual solicitation perpetration, and unwanted sexual solicitation victimization. Results: A four-cluster solution was identified: youth with little to no involvement (n = 1326; 81.7%); perpetrator-victims of Internet harassment (n = 205; 14.3%); victims of both Internet harassment and unwanted sexual solicitation (n = 45; 3.1%); and perpetrator-victims of Internet harassment and unwanted sexual solicitation (n = 12; .9%). Involvement in Internet harassment and unwanted sexual solicitation was associated with concurrent reports of psychosocial problems including substance use; involvement in offline victimization and perpetration of relational, physical, and sexual aggression; delinquent peers; a propensity to respond to stimuli with anger; poor emotional bond with caregivers; and poor caregiver monitoring as compared with youth with little to no involvement. This was especially true for perpetrator-victims of Internet harassment and unwanted sexual solicitation. Findings were replicated using a frequency-based definition of involvement, suggesting that cluster analysis is useful in identifying subgroups of youth and can be used to guide frequency-based definitions, which are easier to implement across study samples. Conclusions: The majority of youth are not frequently involved in Internet harassment or unwanted sexual solicitation either as victims or as perpetrators. Among those who are, however, psychosocial problems are apparent. Perpetrator-victims of Internet harassment and unwanted sexual solicitation have emerged as a particularly important group for adolescent health professionals to be aware of, identify, and treat or refer into services immediately.",2-s2.0-36348932137,1,2007,Journal of Adolescent Health,1

This issue is important inasmuch as the extant literature has clearly shown that the diffusion of sophisticated Internet technology to some places has been slow and that the use of high-speed broadband modems has a significant impact on using the technology for social and economic purposes. The data for this study come from the nationally representative Pew Internet and American Life Study conducted in November 2008 directly after the United States presidential election. Although the results are consistent with previous research on both spatial and digital inequality in terms of Internet use, the interactions between race and place suggest that it is not just that the Obama campaign used new media to mobilize constituents, but that these efforts were realized in a particular region of the country and were particularly influential in given segments of the population.

Human computation is a new and evolving research area that centers around harnessing human intelligence to solve computational problems that are beyond the scope of existing Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms. With the growth of the Web, human computation systems can now leverage the abilities of an unprecedented number of people via the Web to perform complex computation. There are various genres of human computation applications that exist today. Games with a purpose (e.g., the ESP Game) specifically target online gamers who generate useful data (e.g., image tags) while playing an enjoyable game. Crowdsourcing marketplaces (e.g., Amazon Mechanical Turk) are human computation systems that coordinate workers to perform tasks in exchange for monetary rewards. In identity verification tasks, users perform computation in order to gain access to some online content; an example is reCAPTCHA, which leverages millions of users who solve CAPTCHAs every day to correct words in books that optical character recognition (OCR) programs fail to recognize with certainty. This book is aimed at achieving four goals: (1) defining human computation as a research area; (2) providing a comprehensive review of existing work; (3) drawing connections to a wide variety of disciplines, including AI, Machine Learning, HCI, Mechanism/Market Design and Psychology, and capturing their unique perspectives on the core research questions in human computation; and (4) suggesting promising research directions for the future.",2-s2.0-79960222794,1,2011,Synthesis Lectures on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning,1

Background: Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a serious health problem in the Russian Federation. However, the true scale of HIV in Russia has long been the subject of considerable debate. Using digital surveillance to monitor diseases has become increasingly popular in high income countries. But Internet users may not be representative of overall populations, and the characteristics of the Internet-using population cannot be directly ascertained from search pattern data. This exploratory infoveillance study examined if Internet search patterns can be used for disease surveillance in a large middle-income country with a dispersed population. Objective: This study had two main objectives: (1) to validate Internet search patterns against national HIV prevalence data, and (2) to investigate the relationship between search patterns and the determinants of Internet access. Methods: We first assessed whether online surveillance is a valid and reliable method for monitoring HIV in the Russian Federation. Yandex and Google both provided tools to study search patterns in the Russian Federation. We evaluated the relationship between both Yandex and Google aggregated search patterns and HIV prevalence in 2011 at national and regional tiers. Second, we analyzed the determinants of Internet access to determine the extent to which they explained regional variations in searches for the Russian terms for ""HIV"" and ""AIDS"". We sought to extend understanding of the characteristics of Internet searching populations by data matching the determinants of Internet access (age, education, income, broadband access price, and urbanization ratios) and searches for the term ""HIV"" using principal component analysis (PCA). Results: We found generally strong correlations between HIV prevalence and searches for the terms ""HIV"" and ""AIDS"". National correlations for Yandex searches for ""HIV"" were very strongly correlated with HIV prevalence (Spearman rank-order coefficient [rs]=.881, P≤.001) and strongly correlated for ""AIDS"" (rs=.714, P≤.001). The strength of correlations varied across Russian regions. National correlations in Google for the term ""HIV"" (rs=.672, P≤.004) and ""AIDS"" (rs=.584, P≤.001) were weaker than for Yandex. Second, we examined the relationship between the determinants of Internet access and search patterns for the term ""HIV"" across Russia using PCA. At the national level, we found Principal Component 1 loadings, including age (-0.56), HIV search (-0.533), and education (-0.479) contributed 32% of the variance. Principal Component 2 contributed 22% of national variance (income, -0.652 and broadband price, -0.460). Conclusions: This study contributes to the methodological literature on search patterns in public health. Based on our preliminary research, we suggest that PCA may be used to evaluate the relationship between the determinants of Internet access and searches for health problems beyond high-income countries. We believe it is in middle-income countries that search methods can make the greatest contribution to public health.",2-s2.0-84887967703,0,2013,Journal of Medical Internet Research,1

However, their approaches miss information about transfer patterns between different locations. In this paper, we argue that places mobile users have been to should not be considered in isolation. We propose that semantic trajectory should be used to modeling mobile users and semantic trajectory patterns can well characterize users’ transfer patterns between different locations. Then, we propose a novel semantic trajectory similarity measurement to estimate similarity among mobile users. We deploy WiFi detectors in a university to collect WiFi probes, through which we collect around 20G byte data containing hundreds of millions of records.

The use of social media in investor communications is a fairly new phenomenon.

With that ruling, social media communications leaves the sometimes fancy world of creativity and image creation and enters the core of strategic communication linked to corporate viability and success. Investor relations in general are essentially about engaging in dialogues with shareholders. Whereas disseminating information online is quite established, online dialogues offer a greater challenge. Dialogue-oriented and dialogic communication processes are not the same according to speech philosophy; and dialogic communication serves only as one possibility for corporations to build relationships with stakeholders. The research presented here analyzes how listed corporations deal with the highly participatory and fragmented communication environment on the web. The prevalence and intensity of social media dialogues was analyzed in an empirical study that focused on the 150 largest global corporations listed on DJIA (United States), FTSE (United Kingdom), CAC (France), DAX (Germany), and NIKKEI (Japan).

With the development of social media, online social networks offer potential opportunities for firms to analyze user behaviors. Among many, one of the fundamental questions is how to predict product adoption, and the answer to this question lays the foundation for product adoption maximization and demand estimation in large social networks. However, due to the inherent challenges resulting from the dynamic diffusion mechanism in online social networks, such as modeling of activation thresholds and influence probability, differentiating between influence and adoption, and incorporating review content, traditional diffusion models are often not adequate enough to predict product adoption accurately. In order to tackle these challenges, we propose a linear threshold-hurdle model to predict product adoption incorporating social network effects. First, we present a fine-grained activation threshold model based on the five categories of adopters. In addition, we identify three operational factors underlying social network effects, including interaction strength, structural equivalence, and social entity similarity, to model influence probabilities. Furthermore, we distinguish influence spread from adoption spread by introducing a tattle state, in which users express opinions without adopting the product. Finally, we introduce the notion of hurdle to capture the monetary aspect in users' decision making process of product adoption. Based on the proposed linear threshold-hurdle model, two data mining methods based on the rough set technique, namely, decision rules and decomposition trees, are employed to predict product adoption in a large social network. An empirical study of Kindle Fire HD 7 in. tablets is used to illustrate the potential and feasibility of the proposed model. The results demonstrate the predictive power of the proposed model with average F-scores of 89.8% for the week prediction model and of 86.7% for the bi-week prediction model.",2-s2.0-84924860164,1,2015,Information Sciences,1

The arrival of web surveys ushered in new opportunities as well as new restrictions. Web surveys also benefit researchers because they are more efficient. With Facebook, an amalgamation of digital and digitized data collection is needed, which is now possible through Facebook's graph application programming interface (API).

According to the indirect relationship between information and stock trend, information such as comments and tweets can be used for stock trend prediction. When conducting classification on text data, feature sparse issues occur during conversion between tweets and word vectors. Another problem is that the unreliability of average sentiment scores to indicate one day's sentiment. This is especially caused by the unbalanced number between positive and negative within one day, thus a large bias between sentiment and stock trend arises. In addion, information has social attributes when created and diffused in social networks, bias containing people's belief in social networks also have become socialization bias. In order to solve those problems, this work proposes a sentiment analysis based prediction model and an inverse bias algorithm. Instead of applying sentiment analysis to add sentiment related features, this work uses SentiWordNet to give an additional weight to the selected features, and applies two kinds of sentiment analysis to inverse the socialization bias. Aiming at labeling the tweets to sentiment related groups to help find socialization bias, this work also proposes an extended wordlist based on a semi-supervised Naïve Bayes classification algorithm. After finishing the inverse socialization bias, stock trends were used to label example sets. Different classification algorithms were compared in this work. The proposed model with SVM linear algorithm proves to yield accuracy of 90.33% at its best performance.",2-s2.0-84962361613,0,2016,International Journal of Computational Intelligence and Applications,1

The ability to predict when an individual mobile user will leave his current location and where we will move next enables a myriad of qualitatively different Location-Based Services (LBSes) and applications. To this extent, the present paper proposes a statistical method that explicitly performs these related temporal and spatial prediction tasks in three continuous, sequential phases. In the first phase, the method continuously extracts grid-based staytime statistics from the GPS coordinate stream of the location-aware mobile device of the user. In the second phase, from the grid-based staytime statistics, the method periodically extracts and manages regions that the user frequently visits. Finally, in the third phase, from the stream of region-visits, the method continuously estimates parameters for an inhomogeneous continuous-time Markov model and in a continuous fashion predicts when the user will leave his current region and where he will move next. Empirical evaluations, using a number of long, real world trajectories from the Geo-Life data set, show that the proposed method outperforms a state-of-the-art, rule-based trajectory predictor both in terms of temporal and spatial prediction accuracy.",2-s2.0-84875182068,1,2012,"Proc. of the 1st ACM SIGSPATIAL Int.

But such shallow features cannot distinguish between rumor messages and normal messages in many cases. Therefore, in this paper we propose an automatic rumor detection method based on the combination of new proposed implicit features and shallow features of the messages. The proposed implicit features include popularity orientation, internal and external consistency, sentiment polarity and opinion of comments, social influence, opinion retweet influence, and match degree of messages. Experiments illustrate that our rumor detection method obtain significant improvement compared with the state-of-the-art approaches.

Over the past decade, crowd-sourcing complex image analysis tasks to a human crowd has emerged as an alternative to energy-inefficient and difficult-to-implement computational approaches. Following this trend, we have developed a mathematical framework for statistically combining human crowd-sourcing of biomedical image analysis and diagnosis through games. Using a web-based smart game (BioGames), we demonstrated this platform's effectiveness for telediagnosis of malaria from microscopic images of individual red blood cells (RBCs). After public release in early 2012 (http://biogames.ee.ucla.edu), more than 3000 gamers (experts and non-experts) used this BioGames platform to diagnose over 2800 distinct RBC images, marking them as positive (infected) or negative (non-infected). Furthermore, we asked expert diagnosticians to tag the same set of cells with labels of positive, negative, or questionable (insufficient information for a reliable diagnosis) and statistically combined their decisions to generate a gold standard malaria image library. Our framework utilized minimally trained gamers' diagnoses to generate a set of statistical labels with an accuracy that is within 98% of our gold standard image library, demonstrating the ""wisdom of the crowd"". Using the same image library, we have recently launched a web-based malaria training and educational game allowing diagnosticians to compare their performance with their peers. After diagnosing a set of ~500 cells per game, diagnosticians can compare their quantified scores against a leaderboard and view their misdiagnosed cells. Using this platform, we aim to expand our gold standard library with new RBC images and provide a quantified digital tool for measuring and improving diagnostician training globally.",2-s2.0-84928546744,0,2015,Progress in Biomedical Optics and Imaging - Proceedings of SPIE,1

Given intermittent connectivity and spectrum availability, it is a challenging issue regarding how to transmit messages between SUs in a reliable and effective way in CRAHNs. To tackle this challenge, we propose a social-aware opportunistic routing and relay selection scheme, called SoRoute, which first predicts the link reliability based on a new social-relationship-aware mobility model and then fuses the relationships of SUs to make a routing and relay decision. In our design, different prediction schemes are employed for the nodes with different relationships.

This study defined audience interactivity based on people's frequency in using interactive features and three groups were identified-non-interactive audience, average audience, and interactive audience. It compared three audience groups based on traditional audience valuation criteria such as demographics and media consumption levels, as well as newly proposed criteria including online engagement level and electronic word-of-mouth value. Results indicated that interactive audiences are younger, more engaged online, and have higher electronic word-of-mouth value than non-interactive audiences. Because audience interactivity is related to audience value, findings suggest that advertisers should invest more in this highly engaged and influential group online. The results also reveal the need for expanding audience valuation criteria, particularly in the online space, to include other variables such as online engagement level and electronic word-of-mouth influence.

Using the top 30 events, determined by a measure of relative increase in (general) term usage, the results give strong evidence that popular events are normally associated with increases in negative sentiment strength and some evidence that peaks of interest in events have stronger positive sentiment than the time before the peak. It seems that many positive events, such as the Oscars, are capable of generating increased negative sentiment in reaction to them. Nevertheless, the surprisingly small average change in sentiment associated with popular events (typically 1% and only 6% for Tiger Woods' confessions) is consistent with events affording posters opportunities to satisfy pre-existing personal goals more often than eliciting instinctive reactions.",2-s2.0-78951494937,1,2011,Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology,1

Our findings suggest that Twitter is better understood as a tool for political communication, and its usage may be predicted by money spent and race characteristics. As an object, Twitter use has limited power to predict electoral outcomes.",2-s2.0-85018490936,0,2017,Journal of Information Technology and Politics,1

This tutorial provides evidence that character misrepresentation in survey screeners by Amazon Mechanical Turk Workers (""Turkers"") can substantially and significantly distort research findings. Using five studies, we demonstrate that a large proportion of respondents in paid MTurk studies claim a false identity, ownership, or activity in order to qualify for a study. The extent of misrepresentation can be unacceptably high, and the responses to subsequent questions can have little correspondence to responses from appropriately identified participants. We recommend a number of remedies to deal with the problem, largely involving strategies to take away the economic motive to misrepresent and to make it difficult for Turkers to recognize that a particular response will gain them access to a study. The major short-run solution involves a two-survey process that first asks respondents to identify their characteristics when there is no motive to deceive, and then limits the second survey to those who have passed this screen. The long-run recommendation involves building an ongoing MTurk participant pool (""panel"") that (1) continuously collects information that could be used to classify respondents, and (2) eliminates from the panel those who misrepresent themselves.",2-s2.0-85020066608,1,2017,Journal of Consumer Research,1

Social Networking Sites (SNSs) are virtual communities where users can create individual public profiles, interact with real-life friends, and meet other people based on shared interests. They are seen as a 'global consumer phenomenon' with an exponential rise in usage within the last few years. Anecdotal case study evidence suggests that 'addiction' to social networks on the Internet may be a potential mental health problem for some users. However, the contemporary scientific literature addressing the addictive qualities of social networks on the Internet is scarce. Therefore, this literature review is intended to provide empirical and conceptual insight into the emerging phenomenon of addiction to SNSs by: (1) outlining SNS usage patterns, (2) examining motivations for SNS usage, (3) examining personalities of SNS users, (4) examining negative consequences of SNS usage, (5) exploring potential SNS addiction, and (6) exploring SNS addiction specificity and comorbidity. The findings indicate that SNSs are predominantly used for social purposes, mostly related to the maintenance of established offline networks. Moreover, extraverts appear to use social networking sites for social enhancement, whereas introverts use it for social compensation, each of which appears to be related to greater usage, as does low conscientiousness and high narcissism. Negative correlates of SNS usage include the decrease in real life social community participation and academic achievement, as well as relationship problems, each of which may be indicative of potential addiction.",2-s2.0-80053286405,1,2011,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,1

In the past decade, rapid increases in the availability of high-resolution molecular and epidemiological data, combined with developments in statistical and computational methods to simulate and infer migration patterns, have provided key insights into the spatial dynamics of influenza A viruses in humans. In this review, we contrast findings from epidemiological and molecular studies of influenza virus transmission at different spatial scales. We show that findings are broadly consistent in large-scale studies of interregional or inter-hemispheric spread in temperate regions, revealing intense epidemics associated with multiple viral introductions, followed by deep troughs driven by seasonal bottlenecks. However, aspects of the global transmission dynamics of influenza viruses are still debated, especially with respect to the existence of tropical source populations experiencing high levels of genetic diversity and the extent of prolonged viral persistence between epidemics. At the scale of a country or community, epidemiological studies have revealed spatially structured diffusion patterns in seasonal and pandemic outbreaks, which were not identified in molecular studies.We discuss the role of sampling issues in generating these conflicting results, and suggest strategies for future research that may help to fully integrate the epidemiological and evolutionary dynamics of influenza virus over space and time.",2-s2.0-84940260736,1,2013,Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences,1

In this paper, we present a new approach for detecting novel events from social media, specially Twitter, at real-Time. An event is usually defined by who, what, where and when, and an event tweet usually contains terms corresponding to these aspects. To exploit this information, we propose a method that incorporates simple semantics by splitting the tweet term space into groups of terms that have the meaning of the same type. These groups are called semantic categories (classes) and each reflects one or more event aspects. The semantic classes include named entity, mention, location, hashtag, verb, noun and embedded link. To group tweets talking about the same event into the same cluster, similarity measuring is conducted by calculating class-wise similarity and then aggregating them together. Users of a real-Time event detection system are usually only interested in novel (new) events, which are happening now or just happened a short time ago. To fulfill this requirement, a temporal identification module is used to filter out event clusters that are about old stories. The clustering module also computes a novelty score for each event cluster, which reflects how novel the event is, compared to previous events. We evaluated our event detection method using multiple quality metrics and a large-scale event corpus having millions of tweets. The experiment results show that the proposed online event detection method achieves the state-ofthe-Art performance. Our experiment also shows that the temporal identification module can effectively detect old events.",2-s2.0-85021225950,0,2017,Proceedings - International Conference on Data Engineering,1

Outbreaks of infectious disease can pose a significant threat to human health. Thus, detecting and characterizing outbreaks quickly and accurately remains an important problem. This paper describes a Bayesian framework that links clinical diagnosis of individuals in a population to epidemiological modeling of disease outbreaks in the population. Computer-based diagnosis of individuals who seek healthcare is used to guide the search for epidemiological models of population disease that explain the pattern of diagnoses well. We applied this framework to develop a system that detects influenza outbreaks from emergency department (ED) reports. The system diagnoses influenza in individuals probabilistically from evidence in ED reports that are extracted using natural language processing. These diagnoses guide the search for epidemiological models of influenza that explain the pattern of diagnoses well. Those epidemiological models with a high posterior probability determine the most likely outbreaks of specific diseases; the models are also used to characterize properties of an outbreak, such as its expected peak day and estimated size. We evaluated the method using both simulated data and data from a real influenza outbreak. The results provide support that the approach can detect and characterize outbreaks early and well enough to be valuable.

However, most graph keyword search solutions proposed so far primarily focus on a single query setting. We observe that for a popular keyword query system, the number of keyword queries received could be substantially large even in a short time interval, and the chance that these queries share common keywords is quite high. Therefore, answering keyword queries in batches would significantly enhance the performance of the system. Motivated by this, this paper studies efficient batch processing for multiple keyword queries on graph data. Realized that finding both the optimal query plan for multiple queries and the optimal query plan for a single keyword query on graph data are computationally hard, we first propose two heuristic approaches which target maximizing keyword overlap and give preferences for processing keywords with short sizes. Then we devise a cardinality based cost estimation model that takes both graph data statistics and search semantics into account. Based on the model, we design an A∗ based algorithm to find the global optimal execution plan for multiple queries.

Background: Social media has emerged as a potentially powerful medium for communication with adolescents and young adults around their health choices. Objective: The goal of this systematic review is to identify research on the use of social media for interacting with adolescents and young adults in order to achieve positive health outcomes. Methods: A MEDLINE/PubMed electronic database search was performed between January 1, 2002 and October 1, 2013, using terms to identify peer-reviewed research in which social media and other Web 2.0 technologies were an important feature. We used a systematic approach to retrieve papers and extract relevant data. Results: We identified 288 studies involving social media, of which 87 met criteria for inclusion; 75 studies were purely observational and 12 were interventional. The ways in which social media was leveraged by these studies included (1) observing adolescent and young adult behavior (n=77), (2) providing health information (n=13), (3) engaging the adolescent and young adult community (n=17), and (4) recruiting research participants (n=23). Common health topics addressed included high-risk sexual behaviors (n=23), alcohol, tobacco, and other drug use (n=19), Internet safety (n=8), mental health issues (n=18), medical conditions (n=11), or other specified issues (n=12). Several studies used more than one social media platform and addressed more than one health-related topic. Conclusions: Social media technologies offer an exciting new means for engaging and communicating with adolescents and young adults; it has been successfully used to engage this age group, identify behaviors, and provide appropriate intervention and education.

Urban researchers and planners are eager to make use of these abundant, sophisticated, and dynamic data to deepen their understanding on urban form and functions. However, in practice, access to such urban data is limited in China due to institutional constraints on data distribution and data holders’ hesitation to share data. And this hampers urban analytics. To draw reliable conclusions about the workings of complex urban systems, efficient and effective interoperation of multisource urban datasets is needed. Also, dealing with the heterogeneity between datasets is an equally critical challenge, especially for urban planners and government officers. They would derive value from data analytics, but have little data processing experience. To address these issues, we initiated SinoGrids (Plan Xu Xiake), a crowdsourcing platform that standardizes (or “downscales”) microscale urban data in China to facilitate its sharing and interoperation. To assess the performance evaluation of SinoGrids, we propose field-testing with actual urban data and their potential users. Digital desert, a son project of SinoGrids is also included.

So as to explore the potential of the analogical forecasting method using search traffic, we compare the trends of changes in the life cycle with those of search traffic and compare aspects of the search traffic exhibited by both U.S. and Korean consumers over various products. The study results revealed that search traffic trends tended to precede the adoption of a new product; however it accounted for the trends of adoption over the full life-cycle very accurately. In addition, statistically significant relationships have been observed in the search traffic for the same technology even when the traffic originated from distinct nations, languages and web search engines.

Using a sample of 100 hotels randomly selected from the London market, it shows that TripAdvisor displays detailed rich data that can be used in travel planning. Content analysis was used to identify common causes of satisfaction and dissatisfaction among reviewers. It was also discovered that few hotels are actively managing their reputation on the TripAdvisor site. Despite a facility to respond to criticism, few hotels used this option, calling into question how seriously hotels are managing user-generated content. Analyses also suggested that the belief that user-generated content sites have been compromised by false reviews is unfounded, with little evidence being found of reviews with characteristics that typify false postings.",2-s2.0-77956680656,1,2010,Journal of Hospitality Marketing and Management,1

There is an increasing interest in understanding human perception based on reading and writing behaviours. Such researches are interested to seek knowledge of an individual's personality as a way to predict their behaviours and preferences across different contexts and environments. Recent works show significant relation between the reader personality and his reading behaviours. Based on these findings, annotation activity is considered as potential source to predict certain personality traits of readers. In this paper, we take advantage of such theoretical works and we propose an online environment of active reading used to explore practically the utility of annotation in reflecting an accurate user personality profile. We apply the paired t-test to evaluate the system's efficiency to measure human traits versus the scores of personality traits measured using the Neo-IPIP inventory. Our findings show plainly that some traits of users' personalities can be predicted accurately from digital annotation traces during online reading session.",2-s2.0-84945328555,1,2015,"WEBIST 2015 - 11th International Conference on Web Information Systems and Technologies, Proceedings",1

Knowing users' views and demographic traits offers a great potential for personalizing web search results or related services such as query suggestion and query completion. Such signals however are often only available for a small fraction of search users, namely those who log in with their social network account and allow its use for personalization of search results. In this paper, we offer a solution to this problem by showing how user demographic traits such as age and gender, and even political and religious views can be efficiently and accurately inferred based on their search query histories. This is accomplished in two steps; we first train predictive models based on the publically available myPersonality dataset containing users' Facebook Likes and their demographic information. We then match Facebook Likes with search queries using Open Directory Project categories. Finally, we apply the model trained on Facebook Likes to large-scale query logs of a commercial search engine while explicitly taking into account the difference between the traits distribution in both datasets. We find that the accuracy of classifying age and gender, expressed by the area under the ROC curve (AUC), are 77% and 84% respectively for predictions based on Facebook Likes, and only degrade to 74% and 80% when based on search queries. On a US state-by-state basis we find a Pearson correlation of 0:72 for political views between the predicted scores and Gallup data, and 0:54 for affiliation with Judaism between predicted scores and data from the US Religious Landscape Survey. We conclude that it is indeed feasible to infer important demographic data of users from their query history based on labelled Likes data and believe that this approach could provide valuable information for personalization and monetization even in the absence of demographic data.

Social networks are of interest to researchers in part because they are thought to mediate the flow of information in communities and organizations. Here we study the temporal dynamics of communication using on-line data, including e-mail communication among the faculty and staff of a large university over a two-year period. We formulate a temporal notion of ""distance"" in the underlying social network by measuring the minimum time required for information to spread from one node to another - a concept that draws on the notion of vector-clocks from the study of distributed computing systems. We find that such temporal measures provide structural insights that are not apparent from analyses of the pure social network topology. In particular, we define the network backbone to be the subgraph consisting of edges on which information has the potential to flow the quickest. We find that the backbone is a sparse graph with a concentration of both highly embedded edges and long-range bridges - a finding that sheds new light on the relationship between tie strength and connectivity in social networks.

Cooperation is essential for successful human societies. Thus, understanding how cooperative and selfish behaviors spread from person to person is a topic of theoretical and practical importance. Previous laboratory experiments provide clear evidence of social contagion in the domain of cooperation, both in fixed networks and in randomly shuffled networks, but leave open the possibility of asymmetries in the spread of cooperative and selfish behaviors. Additionally, many real human interaction structures are dynamic: we often have control over whom we interact with. Dynamic networks may differ importantly in the goals and strategic considerations they promote, and thus the question of how cooperative and selfish behaviors spread in dynamic networks remains open. Here, we address these questions with data from a social dilemma laboratory experiment. We measure the contagion of both cooperative and selfish behavior over time across three different network structures that vary in the extent to which they afford individuals control over their network ties. We find that in relatively fixed networks, both cooperative and selfish behaviors are contagious. In contrast, in more dynamic networks, selfish behavior is contagious, but cooperative behavior is not: subjects are fairly likely to switch to cooperation regardless of the behavior of their neighbors. We hypothesize that this insensitivity to the behavior of neighbors in dynamic networks is the result of subjects' desire to attract new cooperative partners: even if many of one's current neighbors are defectors, it may still make sense to switch to cooperation. We further hypothesize that selfishness remains contagious in dynamic networks because of the well-documented willingness of cooperators to retaliate against selfishness, even when doing so is costly. These results shed light on the contagion of cooperative behavior in fixed and fluid networks, and have implications for influence-based interventions aiming at increasing cooperative behavior.",2-s2.0-84879249507,1,2013,PLoS ONE,1

Sentiment analysis is about classifying opinions expressed in text. The aim of this study is to improve polarity classification of sentiments in microblogs by building adaptive sentiment lexicons. In the proposed method, corpora-based and lexicon-based approaches are combined and lexicons are generated from text. The sentiment classification is formulated as an optimization problem, in which the goal is to find optimum sentiment lexicons. A novel genetic algorithm is then proposed to solve this optimization problem and find lexicons to classify text. The algorithm generates adaptive sentiment lexicons, and then a meta-level feature is extracted based on it, which is then used alongside Bing Liu's lexicon and n-gram features. The experiments are conducted on six datasets. In terms of accuracy, the results outperform the state-of-the-art methods proposed in the literature in two of the datasets. Also, in four of the datasets, the proposed approach outperforms in terms of F-measure. Applying the proposed method on six datasets, the accuracy is higher than 80% in all six datasets and the F-measure is higher than 80% in four of these datasets. Using the sentiment lexicons created by the proposed algorithm, one can get a better understanding of the specific language and culture of Twitter users and sentiment orientation of words in different contexts. It is also shown that it is useful not to omit the conventional stop-words, as each word can have its sentimental implications.",2-s2.0-85011100006,1,2017,Knowledge-Based Systems,1

Urban-geographical research using location-based social media (LBSM) has itself been characterized by uneven geographies in that most studies deal with Europe and North America. This implies a relative dearth of studies focusing on countries such as China, and this in spite of the country having the largest number of Internet users in the world. This paper proposes to address this lacuna by showing the research potential of LBSM services associated with Weibo, by far the most popular online social microblogging and networking service in China. To this end, we map inter-city connections within the Yangtze River Delta based on three million individuals’ space-time footprints derived from Weibo. Empirical results reveal that the inter-city connections derived from Weibo present both common and specific spatial patterns associated with inter-city travel. We find that a small percentage of cities and city-dyads constitute the backbone of this inter-city network. The dominant direction of individual flows tends to be from primary cities to sub-primary cities, and from peripheral cities to primary cities. In addition, city-dyad connectivities do not strictly follow cities’ positions in terms of their centralities in the hierarchical distribution. Furthermore, the effects of administrative boundaries and cities’ administrative level are significant. We benchmark these insights by re-examining our findings against the backdrop of polycentric developments in the Yangtze River Delta, which confirms the potential usefulness of LBSM data for analyzing urban-geographical patterns.",2-s2.0-84990249824,1,2016,Journal of Urban Technology,1

Human activities increasingly take place in online environments, providing novel opportunities for relating individual behaviors to population-level outcomes. In this paper, we introduce a simple generative model for the collective behavior of millions of social networking site users who are deciding between different software applications. Our model incorporates two distinct mechanisms: one is associated with recent decisions of users, and the other reflects the cumulative popularity of each application. Importantly, although various combinations of the two mechanisms yield long-time behavior that is consistent with data, the only models that reproduce the observed temporal dynamics are those that strongly emphasize the recent popularity of applications over their cumulative popularity. This demonstrates - even when using purely observational data without experimental design - that temporal data-driven modeling can effectively distinguish between competing microscopic mechanisms, allowing us to uncover previously unidentified aspects of collective online behavior.",2-s2.0-84904637610,1,2014,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,1

Australian scholars and politicians have long been concerned about politically uninformed and inactive young Australians. However, few efforts have been made to explain how the use of traditional and online media may affect youth’s participation in politics. Our research utilises the citizen communication mediation model and extends the expected mediation chain by an additional examination of the possible interactions between news media use and political discussions, as suggested by the differential gains model. Using representative data from Australian 10th graders, we examine whether and how news media usage (newspapers, television, radio, and the Internet) affects expected participation in a range of civic and political activities conditional of discussions about political issues (with family, friends, and online). Path models account for additional mediators (civic knowledge and civic efficacy) and control variables to explain future civic and political participation. The results suggest that news media use stimulates political discussions, although different media exert differential effects. Yet, news exposure hardly influences the second mediators (civic knowledge and civic efficacy) in a direct manner. In fact, civic knowledge and efficacy mediate the relationships between political communication and participation, both directly and sequentially. Moderation analyses clarify that despite the mediating role of political discussions, news media exposure also influences (future) civic participation contingent of students’ engagement in (primarily Internet-based) discussions about political and social issues. We emphasise the significance of these results with reference to previous research, discuss potential directions for future research, and draw conclusions for civics and citizenship education.",2-s2.0-84981294428,1,2017,Information Communication and Society,1

Link prediction is a ubiquitous application in many fields which uses partially observed information to predict absence or presence of links between node pairs. The group evolving study provides reasonable explanations on the behaviors of nodes, relations between nodes and community formation in a network. Possible events in group evolution include continuing, growing, splitting, forming and so on. The changes discovered in networks are to some extent the result of these events. In this work, we present a group evolving-based characterization of node's behavioral patterns, and via which we can estimate the probability they tend to interact. In general, the primary aim of this paper is to offer a minimal toy model to detect missing links based on evolution of groups and give a simpler explanation on the rationality of the model. We first introduce perturbations into networks to obtain stable cluster structures, and the stable clusters determine the stability of each node. Then fluctuations, another node behavior, are assumed by the participation of each node to its own belonging group. Finally, we demonstrate that such characteristics allow us to predict link existence and propose a model for link prediction which outperforms many classical methods with a decreasing computational time in large scales. Encouraging experimental results obtained on real networks show that our approach can effectively predict missing links in network, and even when nearly 40% of the edges are missing, it also retains stationary performance.",2-s2.0-85013152271,1,2017,Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications,1

The distribution of sentiment parameters is also restricted by word classes, syntactic and semantic features and functions.

Citation networks have been widely used to study the evolution of science through the lenses of the underlying patterns of knowledge flows among academic papers, authors, research sub-fields, and scientific journals. Here we focus on citation networks to cast light on the salience of homophily, namely the principle that similarity breeds connection, for knowledge transfer between papers. To this end, we assess the degree to which citations tend to occur between papers that are concerned with seemingly related topics or research problems. Drawing on a large data set of articles published in the journals of the American Physical Society between 1893 and 2009, we propose a novel method for measuring the similarity between articles through the statistical validation of the overlap between their bibliographies. Results suggest that the probability of a citation made by one article to another is indeed an increasing function of the similarity between the two articles. Our study also enables us to uncover missing citations between pairs of highly related articles, and may thus help identify barriers to effective knowledge flows. By quantifying the proportion of missing citations, we conduct a comparative assessment of distinct journals and research sub-fields in terms of their ability to facilitate or impede the dissemination of knowledge. Findings indicate that Electromagnetism and Interdisciplinary Physics are the two sub-fields in physics with the smallest percentage of missing citations. Moreover, knowledge transfer seems to be more effectively facilitated by journals of wide visibility, such as Physical Review Letters, than by lower-impact ones.

Following the approach proposed by Da, Engelberg and Gao, the authors construct a set of attention proxies and they compare the ranking with some summary statistics and evaluate the causality relationship among them using a Granger causality test. Results demonstrate that online search frequency is relevant for both institutional and retail funds and normally internet data are able to anticipate the news that will be published in the newspapers. The analysis proposed is focused only on a small real estate market (Italy) where funds are specialized for the type of investor. A wider database can allow excluding that results achieved are biased by the specific features of the market analysed.

The growing popularity of Online Social Networks (OSN) is generating a large amount of communication records that can be easily accessed and analysed to study human social behaviour. This represents a unique opportunity to understand properties of social networks that were impossible to assess in the past. Although analyses on OSN conducted hitherto revealed some important global properties of the networks, there is still a lack of understanding of the mechanisms underpinning these properties, their relation to human behaviour, and their dynamic evolution over time. These aspects are clearly important to understand and characterise OSN and to identify the evolutionary strategy that favoured the diffusion of the use of online communications in our society. In this paper we analyse a data set of Twitter communication records, studying the dynamic processes that govern the maintenance of online social relationships. The results reveal that people in Twitter have highly dynamic social networks, with a large percentage of weak ties and high turnover. This suggests that this behaviour can be the product of an evolutionary strategy aimed at coping with the extremely challenging conditions imposed by our society, where dynamism seems to be the key to success.",2-s2.0-84887299240,1,2013,COSN 2013 - Proceedings of the 2013 Conference on Online Social Networks,1

Social media, such as Twitter and Facebook, allow the creation, sharing and exchange of information among people, companies and brands. This information can be used for several purposes, such as to understand consumers and their preferences. In this direction, the sentiment analysis can be used as a feedback mechanism. This analysis corresponds to classifying a text according to the sentiment that the writer intended to transmit. A basic sentiment classifier determines the sentiment polarity (negative, neutral or positive) of a given text at the document, sentence, or feature/aspect level. Advanced types may consider other elements like the emotional state (e.g. angry, sad, happy), affective states (e.g. pleasure and pain), motivational states (e.g. hunger and curiosity), temperaments, among others. In general, there are two main approaches to attribute sentiment to tweets: based on knowledge; or based on machine learning algorithms. In the latter case, the learning algorithm requires a pre-classified data sample to determine the class of new data. Typically, the sample is pre-classified manually, making the process time consuming and reducing its real time applicability for big data. This paper proposes a polarity analysis framework for Twitter messages, which combines both approaches and an automatic contextual module. To assess the performance of the proposed framework, four text datasets from the literature are used. Five different types of classifiers were considered: Naïve Bayes (NB); Support Vector Machines (SVM); Decision Trees (J48); and Nearest Neighbors (KNN). The results show that the proposal is a suitable framework to automate the whole polarity analysis process, providing high accuracy levels and low false positive rates.",2-s2.0-84940981567,0,2015,Applied Mathematics and Computation,1

This study investigated whether self-reports of alcohol-related postings on Facebook by oneself or one's Facebook friends were related to common motives for drinking and were uniquely predictive of self-reported alcohol outcomes (alcohol consumption, problems, and cravings). Method: Pacific Northwest undergraduates completed a survey of alcohol outcomes, drinking motives, and alcoholrelated Facebook postings. Participants completed the survey online as part of a larger study on alcohol use and cognitive associations. Participants were randomly selected through the university registrar's office and consisted of 1,106 undergraduates (449 men, 654 women, 2 transgender, 1 declined to answer) between the ages of 18 and 25 years (M = 20.40, SD = 1.60) at a large university in the Pacific Northwest. Seven participants were excluded from analyses because of missing or suspect data. Results: Alcohol-related postings on Facebook were significantly correlated with social, enhancement, conformity, and coping motives for drinking (all ps <.001). After drinking motives were controlled for, self-alcohol-related postings independently and positively predicted the number of drinks per week, alcohol-related problems, risk of alcohol use disorders, and alcohol cravings (all ps <.001). In contrast, friends' alcohol- related postings only predicted the risk of alcohol use disorders (p <.05) and marginally predicted alcohol-related problems (p =.07). Conclusions: Posting alcohol-related content on social media platforms such as Facebook is associated with common motivations for drinking and is, in itself, a strong predictive indicator of drinking outcomes independent of drinking motives. Moreover, self-related posting activity appears to be more predictive than Facebook friends' activity.

In this paper, we exploit different facets of the Friends and Family study to deal with two personality-related tasks of paramount importance for the user modeling and ubiquitous computing fields. First, we propose and validate an approach for automatic classification of personality traits based on the ego-networks’ structural characteristics. Our classification results show that (i) mobile phones-based behavioral data can be superior to survey ones for the purposes of personality classification from structural network properties and (ii) particular feature set/network type combinations promise to perform better with given personality traits. Then, we investigate the mediating role played by personality in the context of inducing behavioral change, specifically increasing daily physical activity using social strategies (social comparison and peer pressure). Our results confirm the role played by Extraversion and Neuroticism. Extroverts exposed to a social comparison strategy are positively associated with an increase in physical activity level, while they tend to decrease physical activity level if they are exposed to a peer pressure intervention strategy. Regarding Neuroticism dimension, neurotic people tend to increase their physical daily activity level if they are exposed to a social comparison strategy. Our findings may have implications in designing personality-based behavioral change strategies and suggest to incorporate users’ personality models in the implementation of persuasive systems.

Background: Dabbing is an emerging method of marijuana ingestion. However, little is known about dabbing owing to limited surveillance data on dabbing. Objective: The aim of the study was to analyze Google search data to assess the scope and breadth of information seeking on dabbing. Methods: Google Trends data about dabbing and related topics (eg, electronic nicotine delivery system [ENDS], also known as e-cigarettes) in the United States between January 2004 and December 2015 were collected by using relevant search terms such as ""dab rig."" The correlation between dabbing (including topics: dab and hash oil) and ENDS (including topics: vaping and e-cigarette) searches, the regional distribution of dabbing searches, and the impact of cannabis legalization policies on geographical location in 2015 were analyzed. Results: Searches regarding dabbing increased in the United States over time, with 1,526,280 estimated searches during 2015. Searches for dab and vaping have very similar temporal patterns, where the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) is .992 (P<.001). Similar phenomena were also obtained in searches for hash oil and e-cigarette, in which the corresponding PCC is .931 (P<.001). Dabbing information was searched more in some western states than other regions. The average dabbing searches were significantly higher in the states with medical and recreational marijuana legalization than in the states with only medical marijuana legalization (P=.02) or the states without medical and recreational marijuana legalization (P=.01). Conclusions: Public interest in dabbing is increasing in the United States. There are close associations between dabbing and ENDS searches. The findings suggest greater popularity of dabs in the states that legalized medical and recreational marijuana use. This study proposes a novel and timely way of cannabis surveillance, and these findings can help enhance the understanding of the popularity of dabbing and provide insights for future research and informed policy making on dabbing.",2-s2.0-84989966226,1,2016,Journal of Medical Internet Research,1

Applying the concept of triadic closure to coauthorship networks means that scholars are likely to publish a joint paper if they have previously coauthored with the same people. Prior research has identified moderate to high (20 to 40%) closure rates; suggesting this mechanism is a reasonable explanation for tie formation between future coauthors. We show how calculating triadic closure based on prior operationalizations of closure, namely Newman’s measure for one-mode networks (NCC) and Opsahl’s measure for two-mode networks (OCC) may lead to higher amounts of closure compared to measuring closure over time via a metric that we introduce and test in this paper. Based on empirical experiments using four large-scale, longitudinal datasets, we find a lower bound of 1–3% closure rates and an upper bound of 4–7%. These results motivate research on new explanatory factors for the formation of coauthorship links.",2-s2.0-85016834353,0,2017,Social Network Analysis and Mining,1

Prediction of the growth and decline of infectious disease incidence has advanced considerably in recent years. As these forecasts improve, their public health utility should increase, particularly as interventions are developed that make explicit use of forecast information. It is the task of the research community to increase the content and improve the accuracy of these infectious disease predictions. Presently, operational real-time forecasts of total influenza incidence are produced at the municipal and state level in the United States. These forecasts are generated using ensemble simulations depicting local influenza transmission dynamics, which have been optimized prior to forecast with observations of influenza incidence and data assimilation methods. Here, we explore whether forecasts targeted to predict influenza by type and subtype during 2003-2015 in the United States were more or less accurate than forecasts targeted to predict total influenza incidence. We found that forecasts separated by type/subtype generally produced more accurate predictions and, when summed, produced more accurate predictions of total influenza incidence. These findings indicate that monitoring influenza by type and subtype not only provides more detailed observational content but supports more accurate forecasting. More accurate forecasting can help officials better respond to and plan for current and future influenza activity.",2-s2.0-85019677570,0,2017,American Journal of Epidemiology,1

Social-Forecast explicitly considers the dynamically changing and evolving propagation patterns of videos in social media when making popularity forecasts, thereby being situation and context aware. Social-Forecast aims to maximize the forecast reward, which is defined as a tradeoff between the popularity prediction accuracy and the timeliness with which a prediction is issued. The forecasting is performed online and requires no training phase or a priori knowledge. We analytically bound the prediction performance loss of Social-Forecast as compared to that obtained by an omniscient oracle and prove that the bound is sublinear in the number of video arrivals, thereby guaranteeing its short-term performance as well as its asymptotic convergence to the optimal performance. In addition, we conduct extensive experiments using real-world data traces collected from the videos shared in RenRen, one of the largest online social networks in China. These experiments show that our proposed method outperforms existing view-based approaches for popularity prediction (which are not context-aware) by more than 30% in terms of prediction rewards.",2-s2.0-84961596410,0,2015,IEEE Journal on Selected Topics in Signal Processing,1

Despite the popular use of social media by consumers and marketers, empirical research investigating their economic values still lags. In this study, we integrate qualitative user-marketer interaction content data from a fan page brand community on Facebook and consumer transactions data to assemble a unique data set at the individual consumer level. We then quantify the impact of community contents from consumers (user-generated content, i.e., UGC) and marketers (marketer-generated content, i.e., MGC) on consumers' apparel purchase expenditures. A content analysis method was used to construct measures to capture the informative and persuasive nature of UGC and MGC while distinguishing between directed and undirected communication modes in the brand community. In our empirical analysis, we exploit differences across consumers' fan page joining decision and across timing differences in fan page joining dates for our model estimation and identification strategies. Importantly, we also control for potential self-selection biases and relevant factors such as pricing, promotion, social network attributes, consumer demographics, and unobserved heterogeneity. Our findings show that engagement in social media brand communities leads to a positive increase in purchase expenditures. Additional examinations of UGC and MGC impacts show evidence of social media contents affecting consumer purchase behavior through embedded information and persuasion. We also uncover the different roles played by UGC and MGC, which vary by the type of directed or undirected communication modes by consumers and the marketer. Specifically, the elasticities of demand with respect to UGC information richness are 0.006 (directed communication) and 3.140 (undirected communication), whereas those for MGC information richness are insignificant. Moreover, the UGC valence elasticity of demand is 0.180 (undirected communication), whereas that for MGC valence is 0.004 (directed communication). Overall, UGC exhibits a stronger impact than MGC on consumer purchase behavior.

Big data promises a multitude of innovative options to enhance decision-making by employing algorithmic power to gather worthy information out of large unstructured data sets. Datafication-the exploitation of raw data in many different contexts-can be seen as an attempt to tackle complexity and reduce uncertainty. Accordingly promising are the prospects for innovative applications to gain new insights and valuable knowledge in a variety of domains ranging from business strategy, security to health and medical research, etc. However, big data also entails an increase in complexity that, together with growing automation, may trigger not merely uncertain but also unintended societal events. As a new source of networking power, big data has inherent risks to create new asymmetries and transform possibilities to probabilities that can inter alia affect the autonomy of the individual.

In this paper, we propose a system which enables to delve in the spread of information over a network along with the changes in the user relationships with respect to the domain of discussion. To cope up with the goal, considering Twitter as a case study, we analyse the tweets as the starting point or as the generators of the information which later flows through subsequent retweets. Furthermore, we integrate a N-Gram model classification approach for categorizing, under various domains, the information shared within the social network under consideration. We finally leverage this formalization to propose a domain-based model which aims to estimate the influence of a user, on a community, in the domain under consideration. In conclusion, using a sample of the Twitter network we then present a set of case studies and real case scenarios that show the validity of the proposed approach.

It is common in the study of networks to investigate intermediate-sized (or ""meso-scale"") features to try to gain an understanding of network structure and function. For example, numerous algorithms have been developed to try to identify ""communities,"" which are typically construed as sets of nodes with denser connections internally than with the remainder of a network. In this paper, we adopt a complementary perspective that communities are associated with bottlenecks of locally biased dynamical processes that begin at seed sets of nodes, and we employ several different community-identification procedures (using diffusion-based and geodesic-based dynamics) to investigate community quality as a function of community size. Using several empirical and synthetic networks, we identify several distinct scenarios for ""size-resolved community structure"" that can arise in real (and realistic) networks: (1) the best small groups of nodes can be better than the best large groups (for a given formulation of the idea of a good community); (2) the best small groups can have a quality that is comparable to the best medium-sized and large groups; and (3) the best small groups of nodes can be worse than the best large groups. As we discuss in detail, which of these three cases holds for a given network can make an enormous difference when investigating and making claims about network community structure, and it is important to take this into account to obtain reliable downstream conclusions. Depending on which scenario holds, one may or may not be able to successfully identify ""good"" communities in a given network (and good communities might not even exist for a given community quality measure), the manner in which different small communities fit together to form meso-scale network structures can be very different, and processes such as viral propagation and information diffusion can exhibit very different dynamics. In addition, our results suggest that, for many large realistic networks, the output of locally biased methods that focus on communities that are centered around a given seed node (or set of seed nodes) might have better conceptual grounding and greater practical utility than the output of global community-detection methods. They also illustrate structural properties that are important to consider in the development of better benchmark networks to test methods for community detection.",2-s2.0-84921832415,1,2015,"Physical Review E - Statistical, Nonlinear, and Soft Matter Physics",1

Although online recommendation systems such as recommendation of movies or music have been systematically studied in the past decade, location recommendation in Location Based Social Networks (LBSNs) is not well investigated yet. In LBSNs, users can check in and leave tips commenting on a venue. These two heterogeneous data sources both describe users' preference of venues. However, in current research work, only users' check-in behavior is considered in users' location preference model, users' tips on venues are seldom investigated yet. Moreover, while existing work mainly considers social influence in recommendation, we argue that considering venue similarity can further improve the recommendation performance. In this research, we ameliorate location recommendation by enhancing not only the user location preference model but also recommendation algorithm. First, we propose a hybrid user location preference model by combining the preference extracted from check-ins and text-based tips which are processed using sentiment analysis techniques. Second, we develop a location based social matrix factorization algorithm that takes both user social influence and venue similarity influence into account in location recommendation. Using two datasets extracted from the location based social networks Foursquare, experiment results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid preference model can better characterize user preference by maintaining the preference consistency, and the proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

At the same time, relatively little research has addressed the specific persuasive outcomes that organizations could accrue by using Twitter to communicate with the public in a more dialogic way. We investigated the persuasive effect of an organization's dialogic retweeting (conceptualized as retweeting of user mentions addressed to the organization) by drawing on the concept of social presence and the theory of reasoned action. In an online experiment conducted with an adult sample of U.S. Twitter users, participants were randomly assigned to view either a fictitious organization's dialogic retweets or the same organization's monologic tweets of identical content. We found that the dialogic retweets, when compared to the monologic tweets from the organization, induced a higher level of social presence, which, in turn, led to a higher level of subjective norms, more favorable attitudes toward the behavior advocated by the organization in the messages, and greater intention to adopt the behavior.

Recently, participatory sensing systems, such as Foursquare and Instagram, are becoming very popular. Data shared in these systems have the active participation of users using their portable devices ubiquitously. In this case, these systems can be seen as a kind of sensor network, where users can be considered a social sensor, because the data shared by them are associated with their habits and routines. Thus, can we use data from social sensors, specifically from Foursquare and Instagram, to better understand traffic conditions? This paper shows that data from social sensors and traffic conditions, provided by Bing Maps, are surprisingly very correlated.

Whereas some scholars believe that civic engagement arises naturally from digital media use, others believe that media literacy education is needed to provide the cognitive and social scaffolding that systematically supports civic engagement. Research with a sample of 400 American high school students explores the relationship between participation in a media literacy program, academic ability, frequency of Internet use, information-gathering motives, news and advertising analysis skills, and the intention toward civic engagement. Findings show that students in a selective-admission media literacy program have substantially higher levels of media knowledge and news and advertising analysis skills than other students. Participation in a media literacy program was positively associated with information-seeking motives, media knowledge, and news analysis skills. Moreover, information-seeking motives, media knowledge, and news analysis skills independently contributed to adolescents' intent toward civic engagement.",2-s2.0-84946182738,1,2015,Atlantic Journal of Communication,1

With advances in the Internet and mobile technology, and decreasing cost of mobile devices, large scale pervasive networks are now ubiquitous in solving many earlier service limitations. Here, the challenge lies in its underlying temporal graph. It introduces technical limitations in efficient routing, maximal coverage with minimal latency, data offloading, to effective dissemination over mobile networks or mobility induced dynamic networks. Efficient solution to these interrelated problems lies in the novel prediction strategies for most accurate future contacts (links or interactions), their future contact time etc. In contrast to the existing strategies that consider either network structure or regular pattern and periodic nature of contacts, we propose a novel stochastic Poisson process model (variants of cascaded non-homogeneous Poisson process) that employ multi-recurrent, dependent contact pattern as its basis. We predict number of contacts relative to a node and over all nodes in any future interval, future contact time over a user and a pair of users. Finally, we validate our model with a widely used empirical data set from mobile network, and compare our model with doubly recurrent and homogeneous Poisson process model to conclude the superiority of our prediction model.",2-s2.0-84982812280,1,2016,HotPOST 2016 - Proceedings of the 8th MobiHoc International Workshop on Hot Topics in Planet-Scale mObile computing and online Social Networking,1

User profiling is crucial to many online services. Several recent studies suggest that demographic attributes are predictable from different online behavioral data, such as users' ""Likes"" on Facebook, friendship relations, and the linguistic characteristics of tweets. But location check-ins, as a bridge of users' offline and online lives, have by and large been overlooked in inferring user profiles. In this paper, we investigate the predictive power of location check-ins for inferring users' demographics and propose a simple yet general location to profile (L2P) framework. More specifically, we extract rich semantics of users' check-ins in terms of spatiality, temporality, and location knowledge, where the location knowledge is enriched with semantics mined from heterogeneous domains including both online customer review sites and social networks. Additionally, tensor factorization is employed to draw out low dimensional representations of users' intrinsic check-in preferences considering the above factors. Meanwhile, the extracted features are used to train predictive models for inferring various demographic attributes. We collect a large dataset consisting of profiles of 159, 530 verified users from an online social network. Extensive experimental results based upon this dataset validate that: 1) Location checkins are diagnostic representations of a variety of demographic attributes, such as gender, age, education background, and marital status; 2) The proposed framework substantially outperforms compared models for profile inference in terms of various evaluation metrics, such as precision, recall, F-measure, and AUC.

Most real complex networks-such as protein interactions, social contacts, and the Internet-are only partially known and available to us. While the process of exploring such networks in many cases resembles a random walk, it becomes a key issue to investigate and characterize how effectively the nodes and edges of such networks can be covered by different strategies. At the same time, it is critically important to infer how well can topological measurements such as the average node degree and average clustering coefficient be estimated during such network explorations. The present article addresses these problems by considering random, Barabási-Albert (BA), and geographical network models with varying connectivity explored by three types of random walks: traditional, preferential to untracked edges, and preferential to unvisited nodes. A series of relevant results are obtained, including the fact that networks of the three studied models with the same size and average node degree allow similar node and edge coverage efficiency, the identification of linear scaling with the size of the network of the random walk step at which a given percentage of the nodes/edges is covered, and the critical result that the estimation of the averaged node degree and clustering coefficient by random walks on BA networks often leads to heavily biased results. Many are the theoretical and practical implications of such results.",2-s2.0-33846353202,0,2007,"Physical Review E - Statistical, Nonlinear, and Soft Matter Physics",1

We extract these phenomena from social networks since they reflect the behavior of the crowd. We have implemented the approach in a database system, RandomDB, to show its efficiency and its flexibility over the competitor approaches. We used RandomDB by taking data from Twitter, Facebook and Flickr. The experiments show that these social networks are sources to generate reliable randomness and RandomDB a system that can be used for the task.

As the Internet matures, its initial decentralized form has been increasingly replaced by a small number of ad-financed platforms, such as Facebook and Google, which structure the online experience of billions of people. These platforms often design, control, influence, and “optimize” the user experience according to their own internal values and priorities, sometimes using emergent methods such as algorithmic filtering and computational inference of private traits from computational social science. The shift to a small number of controlling platforms stems from a variety of dynamics, including network effects and the attractions of easier-to-use, closed platforms.

Previous studies have revealed that Internet search data is a new source of data that can be used to predict the stock market. In this new, data-driven research field, choosing a method for preprocessing data is crucial to achieving accurate prediction performance. This paper proposes a preprocessing method of Internet search data: composite leading search index (CLSI), which is composed of three steps: (a) keyword selection, (b) time difference measurement, and (c) leading index composition. We demonstrate the validity of CLSI by comparing this method’s results with the results from search volume index (SVI), which is most commonly used in previous literatures. We build a time series model (TS) with error correction and support vector regression (SVR) for stock trend prediction, and combine into four models for comparison: SVI–TS, CLSI–TS, SVI–SVR, and CLSI–SVR. We test these four models in the context of the Chinese stock market, which interests more and more investors nowadays, and analyzed results in nine datasets: stable periods, peak periods and trough periods of Shanghai Composite Index, Shenzhen Composite Index, and Hushen 300 index respectively. The results show that using TS and SVR as forecasting models, CLSI performs better than SVI on majority of the test dataset while has almost the same performance with that of SVI on the remaining test dataset.

These trends are highly correlated with the searching trends for other queries such as 'pollen count', antihistamines such as loratadine and cetirizine (all r > 0.88 and all P < 0.001), and even the total pollen count collected from 21 pollen counters across the USA (r = 0.928, P < 0.001). Google Trends for allergic rhinitis was similar to the monthly changes in rhinitis symptoms according to the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III, sales for Claritin® and all Over-The-Counter antihistamines, and the number of monthly page views of 'claritin.com'. In conclusion, GT closely reflects the real-world epidemiology of allergic rhinitis in the USA and could potentially be used as a monitoring tool for allergic rhinitis.",2-s2.0-84915781440,1,2015,Allergy: European Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology,1

Although more connections between individuals in a social network can be identified with the development of high techniques, to obtain the complete relation information between individuals is still hard due to complex structure and individual privacy. However, the social networks have communities. In our work, we aim at mining the invisible or missing relations between individuals within a community in social networks. We propose our algorithm according to the fact that the individuals exist in communities satisfying Nash equilibrium, which is borrowed from game-theoretic concepts often used in economic researches. Each hidden relation is explored through the individual's loyalty to their community. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that studies the problem of mining hidden links from the aspect of Nash equilibrium. Eventually we confirm our approach's superiority from extensive experiments over real-world social networks.",2-s2.0-84926519862,1,2014,Theoretical Computer Science,1

Socially-aware mobile networks have become ubiquitous in our daily life, which create the phenomenon of the socially aware mobile big data. Due to the movement of mobile entities, traditional transmission mechanisms are not conducive to the spreading of information. Thus, how to improve the information diffusion performances in socially aware mobile networks has become a hot research topic. However, most of the existing works focus their attention on the information-spreading dynamics rather than on the network structure and nodes' social attributes. In this paper, we proposed the concept of the value strength, social strength as well as a time-varying graph (TVG)-based mobility model from the perspective of the network science, based on which a forwarding nodes' selection scheme was presented. It is beneficial in terms of improving the propagation efficiency and information coverage ratio of mobile networks. Furthermore, sufficient experiments were conducted to verify the diffusion performances both over a range of complex network topologies, such as the Watts-Strogatz small-world network, the Barabási-Albert scale-free network, the real-world Flickr network, and over a TVG-based mobile network. Indeed, the definition of the value/social strength plays a critical role in selecting forwarding links and nodes both for static-topology networks as well as for socially aware mobile networks.",2-s2.0-85007387458,1,2016,IEEE Access,1

The phenomenon of new radical right (NRR) groups is explored through a three-pronged mixed method research design: Firstly, a content analysis of core narrative themes contained on websites of RWE groups; secondly, a thematic analysis of RWE ‘online’ discussion forums; and thirdly, a critical analysis of Google Trends data on the shifting patterns of popularity of various extremism-related search terms amongst the general population. A problem–solution mapping tool that was developed for this research that quantifies the ‘ideological space’ occupied by different ‘new’ RR groups compared with ‘old’ RWE groups is presented. The overall findings are that NRR groups pose political and community challenges to the nature of Australian Society. Moreover, there is evidence of a contest for ideological dominance between ‘old-style’ RWE groups and ‘new-style’ Radical (Far) Right Extremism groups in Australia.

Securing continuous inflows of user created content and promoting them to the potential consumers are basic yet critical tasks for many Internet businesses to succeed in Web 2.0 environments. Managers of Web 2.0 services need to quickly identify value-adding content and encourage the content contributors to keep supplying valuable content. This study surveys the previous literature to explain the lifespan of user created content and proposes a theoretical framework that considers three major stakeholders in the Web 2.0 business environments - content contributors, content consumers, and service platform providers. Based on the theoretical understanding, a model that explains the survivability of a user created content is developed and empirically tested using three months of log data collected by an Internet personal broadcasting service provider. The proposed theoretical framework provides researchers with insights into the interworking of the three major players in the novel business environments. The results of the empirical analysis suggest that content providers' commitments and positive rewards to intrinsic motivations, content consumers' acceptances and perceived popularity of available content, and the service platform provider's support for social network capabilities and popularity signaling mechanisms are important factors that Web 2.0 service providers must carefully manage in order to improve the longevity of value-adding user created content.",2-s2.0-84875448373,0,2013,Decision Support Systems,1

Friendster is a social networking service which used to be popular at the beginning of the twenty-first century. Some analysis implies that the user network on Friendster collapsed from the “outside” of the layered structure of the cores. However, it is still not clear if the network really collapsed from the outside. We analyze the time evolution of the network structure more exactly to check whether that is true. It is shown that the collapse of the Friendster network actually started from the “center” of the core structure. Following this result, we attempt to explain its mechanism by a propagation model. We conclude that the time evolution of core structure can be explained by the two rules: (a) non-users who have many friends on Friendster are likely to register for Friendster, and (b) users who have many friends that have already left Friendster are also likely to leave. The users who have few friends on Friendster tend to leave soon and that may have also played a key role in the time evolution of the core structure. Moreover, under the assumption that our model is valid, we discuss what to do to prevent the decline of online communities. First, it is not effective to promote registration in maintaining the number of active users. Second, it is effective to promote non-active users to become active again.

In order to meet the demands of an overcrowded computer lab, a technology instructor designs a plan that is outside the paradigm of what is considered to be ""standard operating procedure"" for implementing and integrating technology into a course in a teacher education program. To accommodate 125 students in a computer classroom that only has 20 seats and computers, portable media devices with Web 2.0 technology, micro-blogging and a social media network were incorporated as part of the course curriculum. These solutions were chosen because most social media networks are easily accessible via portable media devices and virtually every college-aged student already knows how to use them with little-to-no training. Additionally, Web 2.0 allows for on-line collaboration and sharing, and website interfaces behave like software, thus enabling students to work and communicate easily outside of class. Although the use of technology did facilitate innovation in course activities, there were many challenges throughout the semester and suggestions for improvement in the future.

Managing bipolar disorder is an important health issue that can strongly affect the patient's quality of life during occurrences of depressive or manic episodes and is therefore a growing burden to healthcare systems. A widely practised method of monitoring the course of the disorder is by mood and general mental health questionnaires, which are nowadays often implemented on mobile electronic devices. Detecting changes to daily routine and behaviour is of crucial importance as they can be symptomatic of an ongoing episode, or in the case of an external cause, may trigger such an episode. Current mobile phones and geospatial technology provide a means of monitoring aspects of daily routine and lifestyle which may be valuable in facilitating self-management of the condition. This manuscript introduces a methodology for analysing data obtained from a simple wearable system based on a mid-range mobile phone, along with trial results from a control group of three participants with no history of Bipolar Disorder.

Differently, we assume that collective analysis could be better performed when exploiting overlaps among distinct posts of the collection. Thus, we propose SACI (Sentiment Analysis by Collective Inspection), a lexicon-based unsupervised method that extracts collective sentiments without concerning with individual classifications. SACI is based on a directed transition graph among terms of a post set and on a prior classification of these terms regarding their roles in consolidating opinions. Paths represent subsets of posts on this graph and the collective opinion is defined by traversing all paths. Besides demonstrating that collective analysis outperforms individual one w.r.t. approximating collection opinions, assessments on SACI show that good individual classifications do not guarantee good collective analysis and vice-versa. Further, SACI fulfills simultaneously requirements of efficacy, efficiency and handle of dynamicity posed by high demanding scenarios.

The repertoires and rhetoric of Estonian internet activists. The literature on political participation and activism has gained from introducing a new term: 'subactivism', which is used to describe individual, mostly internet-mediated activism of everyday choices. Yet there is ongoing work dedicated to the question of how these everyday choices relate to other repertoires of activism. Why do people choose to participate in politics in one form rather than in another? This paper contributes to the field by analysing the rhetoric and repertoire of activists who are organised around two NGOs: the Estonian Pirate Party and the Estonian Internet Society. Based on ethnographic fieldwork, analyses of online materials, and 15 in-depth interviews, findings indicate that the choice of repertoire is strongly connected to the activists' views on the internet, activism and politics. Most importantly, understanding what 'politics' stands for influences the choice of subactivism as suitable or unsuitable action for these groups.

However, even though PCTs are used extensively, it remains unclear why individual features are used. There is little IS research on the criteria according to which users decide between these PCT features. Therefore, this study investigates why individuals use different PCT features. In so doing, we reveal linkages between the features and the personal values that users try to derive while using them. We draw on the means-end chain approach, which provides a conceptual framework for identifying product attributes, their consequences and associated values. To obtain these factors, we conducted laddering interviews with PCT users.

Facing these possible and unexpected disasters, understanding and simulating of human emergency mobility following disasters will become the critical issue for planning effective humanitarian relief, disaster management, and long-term societal reconstruction. However, due to the uniqueness of various disasters and the unavailability of reliable and large scale human mobility data, such kind of research is very difficult to be performed. Hence, in this paper, we collect big and heterogeneous data (e.g. 1.6 million users' GPS records in three years, 17520 times of Japan earthquake data in four years, news reporting data, transportation network data and etc.) to capture and analyze human emergency mobility following different disasters. By mining these big data, we aim to understand what basic laws govern human mobility following disasters, and develop a general model of human emergency mobility for generating and simulating large amount of human emergency movements. The experimental results and validations demonstrate the efficiency of our simulation model, and suggest that human mobility following disasters may be significantly more predictable and can be easier simulated than previously thought.

Objective We aimed to investigate at which level there is evidence of the relationship between observable information from Facebook profile and pathological personality traits. To do so, we performed a systematic review and a meta-analysis when sufficient information was presented. Method A literature search was made using a search strategy including the keywords “personality disorders” (and variations as supplied by Mesh from PubMed engines) and ""Social Networking” (and variations). Fixed effects models were used to generate standardized coefficient. Results and discussion: Were included 10 articles (encompassing 12 studies) with 2.780 participants. The analyses indicated that researches relating Facebook observable information to pathological personality traits are scarce and primarily focused on narcissism traits in the relation with Facebook number of friends. Meta-analysis using number of friends and narcissistic measures showed a significant and moderate effect size, with an observed heterogeneity (I2) equal to 15%. Conclusions Studies relating pathological personality traits to Facebook observable information are scarce, however the number of friends seems to be promising as predictor of narcissism traits. More data must be aggregated including other observable information. In addition, future researches should present some basic and exploratory analysis, making data more comparable through articles.",2-s2.0-85012191648,0,2017,Computers in Human Behavior,1

Our algorithm relies solely on the sensor inputs of the mobile device to gather environmental fingerprints. A real-time hierarchical clustering algorithm efficiently organizes the individual signatures into a hierarchy of meaningful significant locations at various time scale. By applying (normalized) information measure and neural network based learning, we are able to identify the most salient transition patterns that best characterize the mobility data of the user. Our algorithms are completely online, and do not rely on any networked resources. Thus, user can gain insight to their own mobility activities, and has total control of how this information is to be shared with other applications. We will demonstrate using real-life data the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach. Several appealing visualizations will be showcased.

The concept of business agility reflects an organizations need to develop sensing capabilities for being able to respond to changes in the business environment rapidly. Therefore, intelligent information systems are needed to support decision makers with accurate and timely information. Since corporate reputation is among the most valuable assets, organizations need efficient measuring techniques for being able to manage it. Recently, due to the advent of social media new reputational challenges have emerged for firms, since such technologies significantly increase the risk for being associated with negative issues. Therefore, organizations should utilize there IT-systems for actively sensing social media content as a basis for a quick response to reputational threats. Accordingly, we provide an empirical example on how firms might improve corporate reputation management through sensing social media. Specifically, we analyze a dataset of 271,207 messages about a large American Bank collected from the public microblogging platform Twitter. For our empirical investigation, we applied automated sentiment analysis and manual content analysis. Our results demonstrate how social media might impact corporate reputation and what organizations can do to prepare themselves.

Natural calamities and man-made hazards can occur in an unexpected and unanticipated manner. They cause large-scale damage, create disruptions, and need instant reaction. In the event of sudden onset of a crisis, rapid formulation of a notification strategy, timely dispatch of alerts, and action on those alerts are important elements of early warning systems that can save lives. However, current methods of disaster alerting lack in the area of targeted communication of hazard information. Location data of the population available as a spatial data stream can allow dynamic identification of homogeneous clusters of people. Crisis notifications can then be targeted by personalizing information and instructions for each cluster. In this paper, we present an approach for dynamically partitioning a region into areas around a hazard using clustering of real-time streaming data to aid emergency response management. We lay down important requirements for the clustering technique from the perspective of our scenario and select an algorithm for our implementation after comparison with others.

Real-world, multiple-typed objects are often interconnected, forming heterogeneous information networks. The problem of predicting links or interactions between objects in a network is an important task of network analysis. Different from traditional link prediction tasks in homogeneous networks, heterogeneous information networks have multiple distinct types of interrelated objects and relationships, and the objects in heterogeneous networks can be connected via different relationships. In this paper, we use meta-path, a kind of path that connects object types via a sequence of relations, to describe distinct semantics of different types of nodes and relationships, and propose a meta path-based link prediction model for heterogeneous information networks (MPLP). In this model we perform link prediction by combining the link probabilities between nodes on different meta-paths. The method is evaluated with two different genres of datasets: DBLP and Last. fm. Experimental results show that when predicting the formation of seven types of relationships, the AUC value of our method is on average improved 5.93% compared with the most accurate method. Furthermore, distinguishing different types of nodes and relationships by using meta-paths can improve the prediction accuracy significantly. At last, in order to balance the prediction accuracy and the scalability of our model, an experimental analysis demonstrates that considering meta-paths whose lengths are less than 5 is enough to produce good results in terms of link prediction.",2-s2.0-84899096200,1,2014,Jisuanji Xuebao/Chinese Journal of Computers,1

Natural disasters affect hundreds of millions of people worldwide every year. Emergency response efforts depend upon the availability of timely information, such as information concerning the movements of affected populations. The analysis of aggregated and anonymized Call Detail Records (CDR) captured from the mobile phone infrastructure provides new possibilities to characterize human behavior during critical events. In this work, we investigate the viability of using CDR data combined with other sources of information to characterize the floods that occurred in Tabasco, Mexico in 2009. An impact map has been reconstructed using Landsat-7 images to identify the floods. Within this frame, the underlying communication activity signals in the CDR data have been analyzed and compared against rainfall levels extracted from data of the NASA-TRMM project. The variations in the number of active phones connected to each cell tower reveal abnormal activity patterns in the most affected locations during and after the floods that could be used as signatures of the floods - both in terms of infrastructure impact assessment and population information awareness.

Opportunistic data collection in wireless sensor networks uses passing smartphones to collect data from sensor nodes, thus avoiding the cost of multiple static sink nodes. Based on the observed mobility patterns of smartphone users, sensor data should be preforwarded to the nodes that are visited more frequently with the aim of improving network throughput. In this article, we construct a formal network model and an associated theoretical optimization problem to maximize the throughput subject to energy constraints of sensor nodes. Since a centralized controller is not available in opportunistic data collection, data pre-forwarding (DPF) must operate as a distributed mechanism in which each node decides when and where to forward data based on local information. Hence, we develop a simple distributed DPF mechanism with two heuristic algorithms, implement this proposal in Contiki-OS, and evaluate it thoroughly. We demonstrate empirically, in simulations, that our approach is close to the optimal solution obtained by a centralized algorithm. We also demonstrate that this approach performs well in scenarios based on real mobility traces of smartphone users. Finally, we evaluate our proposal on a small laboratory testbed, demonstrating that the distributed DPF mechanism with heuristic algorithms performs as predicted by simulations, and thus that it is a viable technique for opportunistic data collection through smartphones.",2-s2.0-84907206262,1,2014,ACM Transactions on Sensor Networks,1

Mobile phone data have been collected in eight cities in Northeast China and used to extract individuals' movement trajectories. The massive mobile phone data provides a wide coverage and detailed depiction of individuals' movement in space and time. Considering that most individuals' movement is limited within particular urban areas, boundaries of urban agglomerations are demarcated based on the spatial distribution of mobile phone base towers. Results indicate that the distribution of human's intra-urban travel in general follows the exponential law. The exponents, however, vary from city to city and indicate the impact of city sizes and shapes. Individuals living in large or less compact cities generally need to travel farther on a daily basis, and vice versa.

We propose a statistical time-aware framework to identify the users who differ from the usual behavior by being repeatedly and persistently among the first to collect the items that later become hugely popular. Since these users effectively discover future hits, we refer them as discoverers. We use the proposed framework to demonstrate that discoverers are present in a wide range of real systems. Once identified, discoverers can be used to predict the future success of new items. We finally introduce a simple network model which reproduces the discovery patterns observed in the real data.

However, this is at risk for mobile users since they may not have any knowledge about the users they socially connect with. Trust management then appears as a promising decision support for mobile users in establishing social links. However, while the literature is rich of trust models, most approaches lack appropriate trust bootstrapping, i.e., the initialization of trust values. This paper addresses this challenge by introducing proximity-based trust initialization based on the users' behavioral data available from their mobile devices or other types of social interactions.

These users and relationships can be naturally represented as a dynamic multi-view network, which is a set of weighted graphs with shared common nodes but having their own respective edges. Different network views, representing structural relationship and interaction types, could have very distinctive properties individually and these properties may change due to interplay across views. Therefore, it is of interest to study how multiple views interact and affect network dynamics and, in addition, explore possible applications to social networking. In this paper, we propose approaches to capture and analyze multi-view network dynamics from various aspects. Through our proposed descriptors, we observe the synergy and cannibalization between different user groups and network views from LinkedIn dataset.

Social scientists are often interested in understanding how the dynamics of social systems are driven by the behavior of individuals that make up those systems. However, this process is hindered by the difficulty of experimentally studying how individual behavioral tendencies lead to collective social dynamics in large groups of people interacting over time. In this study, we investigate the role of social influence, a process well studied at the individual level, on the puzzling nature of success for cultural products such as books, movies, and music. Using a ""multiple-worlds"" experimental design, we are able to isolate the causal effect of an individual-level mechanism on collective social outcomes. We employ this design in a Web-based experiment in which 2,930 participants listened to, rated, and downloaded 48 songs by up-and-coming bands. Surprisingly, despite relatively large differences in the demographics, behavior, and preferences of participants, the experimental results at both the individual and collective levels were similar to those found in Salganik, Dodds, and Watts (2006). Further, by comparing results from two distinct pools of participants, we are able to gain new insights into the role of individual behavior on collective outcomes.

Here we investigate the dynamics of visitation of a major news portal, representing the prototype for such a rapidly evolving network. The nodes of the network can be classified into stable nodes, which form the time-independent skeleton of the portal, and news documents. The visitations of the two node classes are markedly different, the skeleton acquiring visits at a constant rate, while a news document's visitation peaks after a few hours. We find that the visitation pattern of a news document decays as a power law, in contrast with the exponential prediction provided by simple models of site visitation. This is rooted in the inhomogeneous nature of the browsing pattern characterizing individual users: the time interval between consecutive visits by the same user to the site follows a power-law distribution, in contrast to the exponential expected for Poisson processes. We show that the exponent characterizing the individual user's browsing patterns determines the power-law decay in a document's visitation. Finally, our results document the fleeting quality of news and events: while fifteen minutes of fame is still an exaggeration in the online media, we find that access to most news items significantly decays after 36 hours of posting.",2-s2.0-33745606182,1,2006,"Physical Review E - Statistical, Nonlinear, and Soft Matter Physics",1

The queries people issue to a search engine and the results clicked following a query change over time. For example, after the earthquake in Japan in March 2011, the query japan spiked in popularity and people issuing the query were more likely to click government-related results than they would prior to the earthquake. We explore the modeling and prediction of such temporal patterns in Web search behavior. We develop a temporal modeling framework adapted from physics and signal processing and harness it to predict temporal patterns in search behavior using smoothing, trends, periodicities, and surprises. Using current and past behavioral data, we develop a learning procedure that can be used to construct models of users' Web search activities. We also develop a novel methodology that learns to select the best prediction model from a family of predictive models for a given query or a class of queries. Experimental results indicate that the predictive models significantly outperform baseline models that weight historical evidence the same for all queries. We present two applications where new methods introduced for the temporal modeling of user behavior significantly improve upon the state of the art. Finally, we discuss opportunities for using models of temporal dynamics to enhance other areas of Web search and information retrieval.",2-s2.0-84894515411,1,2013,ACM Transactions on Information Systems,1

This book studies the rise of social media in the first decade of the twenty-first century, up until 2012. It provides both a historical and a critical analysis of the emergence of networking services in the context of a changing ecosystem of connective media. Such history is needed to understand how the intricate constellation of platforms profoundly affects our experience of online sociality. In a short period of time, services like Facebook, YouTube and many others have come to deeply penetrate our daily habits of communication and creative production. While most sites started out as amateur-driven community platforms, half a decade later they have turned into large corporations that do not just facilitate user connectedness, but have become global information and data mining companies extracting and exploiting user connectivity. Offering a dual analytical prism to examine techno-cultural as well as socio-economic aspects of social media, the author dissects five major platforms: Facebook, Twitter, Flickr, YouTube, and Wikipedia. Each of these microsystems occupies a distinct position in the larger ecosystem of connective media, and yet, their underlying mechanisms for coding interfaces, steering users, filtering content, governance and business models rely on shared ideological principles. Reconstructing the premises on which these platforms are built, this study highlights how norms for online interaction and communication gradually changed. ""Sharing,"" ""friending,"" ""liking,"" ""following,"" ""trending,"" and ""favoriting"" have come to denote online practices imbued with specific technological and economic meanings. This process of normalization is part of a larger political and ideological battle over information control in an online world where everything is bound to become ""social.""",2-s2.0-84917742994,1,2013,The Culture of Connectivity: A Critical History of Social Media,1

Background: Although primarily used for social networking and often used for social support and dissemination, data on social media platforms are increasingly being used to facilitate research. However, the ethical challenges in conducting social media research remain of great concern. Although much debated in the literature, it is the views of the public that are most pertinent to inform future practice. Objective: The aim of our study was to ascertain attitudes on the ethical considerations of using social media as a data source for research as expressed by social media users and researchers. Methods: A systematic review was conducted, wherein 16 databases and 2 Internet search engines were searched in addition to handsearching, reference checking, citation searching, and contacting authors and experts. Studies that conducted any qualitative methods to collect data on attitudes on the ethical implications of research using social media were included. Quality assessment was conducted using the quality of reporting tool (QuaRT) and findings analyzed using inductive thematic synthesis. Results: In total, 17 studies met the inclusion criteria. Attitudes varied from overly positive with people expressing the views about the essential nature of such research for the public good, to very concerned with views that social media research should not happen. Underlying reasons for this variation related to issues such as the purpose and quality of the research, the researcher affiliation, and the potential harms. The methods used to conduct the research were also important. Many respondents were positive about social media research while adding caveats such as the need for informed consent or use restricted to public platforms only. Conclusions: Many conflicting issues contribute to the complexity of good ethical practice in social media research. However, this should not deter researchers from conducting social media research. Each Internet research project requires an individual assessment of its own ethical issues. Guidelines on ethical conduct should be based on current evidence and standardized to avoid discrepancies between, and duplication across, different institutions, taking into consideration different jurisdictions.",2-s2.0-85021783459,1,2017,Journal of Medical Internet Research,1

Considering the personality recognition as a multi-label classification problem, this paper proposes a new probabilistic topic model (PT-LDA model) to predict the personality traits within the framework of Five Factor Model. The proposed model extends the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model to integrate the n-gram features into few latent topics and each topic is characterized by not only the multinomial distribution over words but also the Gaussian distributions over personality traits. This paper develops a Gibbs-EM algorithm to solve the proposed model iteratively based on Gibbs sampling and expectation maximization. Quantitative evaluation shows that PT-LDA is more accurate, efficient and robust than several baselines. Our experiment also shows that the proposed model can be used to extract the interpretable topics associated with each personality trait, which provides a new way to uncover user behaviors in online social network.",2-s2.0-84991213169,1,2016,Neurocomputing,1

Emotion-related textual indicators, including emoticon use, were extracted form users' Facebook posts via automated text analysis. Correlation analyses revealed that individuals with higher levels of depression, anxiety expressed negative emotions on Facebook more frequently. In addition, use of emoticons expressing positive emotions correlated negatively with stress level. When comparing age groups, younger users reported higher frequency of both emotion-related words and emoticon use in their posts. Also, the relationship between online emotional expression and self-report emotional well-being was generally stronger in the younger group.

Social media have experienced a spectacular rise in popularity, attracting hundreds of millions of users and generating unprecedented amount of content that increasingly contain location and place information. Collectively, the massive location information in these data provides an excellent opportunity to better understand many geographic phenomena and geospatial dynamics in a timely fashion. Recent studies capitalizing on social networking and media data show significant societal impacts in many areas including prediction of stock market and infectious disease surveillance. However, because location-based social media data are often massive, generated dynamically, and unstructured, significant computation, data, and visualization challenges need to be resolved. This research aims to demonstrate the use of massive social media data to interactively analyze spatiotemporal events across spatial and temporal scales, by establishing a data-driven framework using cyberGIS - geographic information systems (GIS) based on advanced cyberinfrastructure - to resolve aforementioned challenges. Specifically, FluMapper - an application on the CyberGIS Gateway - is employed as a case study to demonstrate the data-driven framework and seamless integration of massive location-based social media data and spatial analytical services within the online problem solving environment of the Gateway. FluMapper presents integrated results from two complementary spatial analyses: (i) an interactive exploration of spatial distribution of flu risk and (ii) dynamic mapping of movement patterns, across multiple spatial, and temporal scales. The seamless integration of these two analyses through the framework illustrates the potential of cyberGIS to resolve the compute and data challenges of analyzing near real-time social media data in an efficient and scalable manner and to support interactive visualization.

The objective of Web-based expert epidemic intelligence systems is to detect health threats. The Global Health Security Initiative (GHSI) Early Alerting and Reporting (EAR) project was launched to assess the feasibility and opportunity for pooling epidemic intelligence data from seven expert systems. EAR participants completed a qualitative survey to document epidemic intelligence strategies and to assess perceptions regarding the systems performance. Timeliness and sensitivity were rated highly illustrating the value of the systems for epidemic intelligence. Weaknesses identified included representativeness, completeness and flexibility. These findings were corroborated by the quantitative analysis performed on signals potentially related to influenza A/H5N1 events occurring in March 2010. For the six systems for which this information was available, the detection rate ranged from 31% to 38%, and increased to 72% when considering the virtual combined system. The effective positive predictive values ranged from 3% to 24% and F1-scores ranged from 6% to 27%. System sensitivity ranged from 38% to 72%. An average difference of 23% was observed between the sensitivities calculated for human cases and epizootics, underlining the difficulties in developing an efficient algorithm for a single pathology. However, the sensitivity increased to 93% when the virtual combined system was considered, clearly illustrating complementarities between individual systems.

The rise of big data—data that are not only large and massively multivariate but concern a dizzying array of phenomena—represents a watershed moment for the social sciences. These data have created demand for new methods that reduce/simplify the dimensionality of data, identify novel patterns and relations, and predict outcomes, from computational ethnography and computational linguistics to network science, machine learning, and in situ experiments. Such developments have led scholars to begin new lines of social inquiry. Company engineers, computer scientists, and social scientists have all converged on big data, creating the possibility of a vibrant “trading zone” for collaboration. However, strong differences in research frameworks help explain why big data may not be an egalitarian trading zone across fields, but rather—at least in the short term—a moment when engineering colonizes sociology more than vice versa. In the long term, however, we suggest there may be the possibility of a constructive synthesis across paradigms in what we term ‘forensic social science.’",2-s2.0-84959119436,1,2016,American Sociologist,1

We test this conjecture empirically using data about the copurchase networks and demand levels associated with more than 250,000 interconnected books offered on Amazon.com over the period of one year while controlling for alternative explanations of demand correlation using a variety of approaches. Our findings suggest that on average the explicit visibility of a copurchase relationship can lead to up to an average threefold amplification of the influence that complementary products have on each others' demand levels.

Significant world events often cause the behavioral convergence of the expression of shared sentiment. This paper examines the use of the blogosphere as a framework to study user psychological behaviors, using their sentiment responses as a form of 'sensor' to infer real-world events of importance automatically. We formulate a novel temporal sentiment index function using quantitative measure of the valence value of bearing words in blog posts in which the set of affective bearing words is inspired from psychological research in emotion structure. The annual local minimum and maximum of the proposed sentiment signal function are utilized to extract significant events of the year and corresponding blog posts are further analyzed using topic modeling tools to understand their content. The paper then examines the correlation of topics discovered in relation to world news events reported by the mainstream news service provider, Cable News Network, and by using the Google search engine. Next, aiming at understanding sentiment at a finer granularity over time, we propose a stochastic burst detection model, extended from the work of Kleinberg, to work incrementally with stream data. The proposed model is then used to extract sentimental bursts occurring within a specific mood label (for example, a burst of observing 'shocked'). The blog posts at those time indices are analyzed to extract topics, and these are compared to real-world news events. Our comprehensive set of experiments conducted on a large-scale set of 12 million posts from Livejournal shows that the proposed sentiment index function coincides well with significant world events while bursts in sentiment allow us to locate finer-grain external world events.",2-s2.0-84885841289,0,2013,Knowledge and Information Systems,1

Having a large social network is generally beneficial to health. However, it is unclear how Internet-based social networks might influence health. Chronic stress can have negative health consequences, and some data suggest that Facebook could be a new source of psychological stress. Thus, we examined undergraduate college student perceptions of Facebook use and incidence of upper respiratory infections (URIs). We hypothesized that subjects with more diverse networks (i.e., more friends on Facebook) would have fewer URIs than their less diverse counterparts; that subjects reporting Facebook-induced stress would be more susceptible to URIs; and that subjects with more diverse networks who report Facebook-induced stress would be less susceptible to URIs than subjects with less diverse social networks who reported Facebook-induced stress. In this prospective study, healthy college students completed online questionnaires that assessed use and perceptions of Facebook and technology, and then were interviewed weekly for 10 weeks to track incidence of URI. URI episodes were defined by a symptom-based criterion. The social network size was significantly related to the rate of URI, such that, the larger the social network, the greater the incidence rate of URI. Most (85.7 percent) respondents experienced some degree of Facebook-induced stress. The effects of Facebook-induced stress on incidence of URI varied across the social network size, such that, the impact of stress on the URI incidence rate increased with the size of the social network. These results are largely in contrast to our hypotheses, but clearly suggest an association between Facebook use, psychological stress, and health.",2-s2.0-84871065797,1,2012,"Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking",1

Social network sites (SNSs) have brought revolutionary changes to individuals' social interactions. The growth of online personal relationships is crucial for understanding current interpersonal communications and network dynamics. In the context of a Chinese SNS, this study provides an empirical presentation of the growth patterns of individuals' online friendships. This study uncovers the regularity as well as the variability of such growth patterns. On the one hand, the friendship growth patterns show regularity in that the time trajectory of friendship growth for most users levels off at some point of their friendship formation. On the other hand, the growth patterns of online friendships also demonstrate variability. There are three essentially different growth patterns emerged: the logistic pattern (i.e., S-shape), the double-logistic pattern (i.e., double-S shape), and the power pattern (i.e., rotated-L shape). By employing multinomial logistic regression, this study further found that network connectedness lead to the differences in these growth patterns of online friendships. However, a user's personal strategy of online friendship formation is found to have a nil effect on explaining the differences in growth patterns of online friendships. This paper concludes by discussing the theoretical and practical implications of the growth patterns of online relationships.

Active involvement in discussion-based communities is nowadays a firm part of people's online activities. The measurement of communication ties and networks between contributors to such domains is thus becoming a relevant research question in social sciences. However, especially in web forums, very often almost no direct relational information exists that would indicate the presence of communication ties among contributors. In contrast with the reply-to structure of Usenet newsgroup or mailing list conversations that contain explicit relational information created by the contributors, some web forums only enable participants to add new posts to threads or to quote preceding posts in threads. When discussions emerge, it is difficult to identify who is replying to whom. Drawing on the social network studies dealing with the conversational patterns in Usenet and web forums, this paper presents an alternative approach to identifying the ties between authors of posts. Several assumptions are discussed, and different measures are developed and empirically evaluated.

However, what appeared to be far less likely was any increased willingness or tendency for committed partisans to shift their allegiances as a result of their Twitter engagements, and we postulate that Twitter usage at present is likely to further embed partisan loyalties during electoral periods rather than loosen them; a dynamic that would seemingly contribute to political polarization.",2-s2.0-84900858905,1,2013,Policy and Internet,1

493,3121,Alim S.,An initial exploration of ethical research practices regarding automated data extraction from online social media user profiles,"An initial exploration of ethical research practices regarding automated data extraction from online social media user profiles. The popularity of social media, especially online social networks, has led to the availability of potentially rich sources of data, which researchers can use for extraction via automated means. However, the process of automated extraction from user profiles results in a variety of ethical considerations and challenges for researchers. This paper examines this question further, surveying researchers to gain information regarding their experiences of, and thoughts about, the challenges to ethical research practices associated with automated extraction. Results indicated that, in comparison with two or three years ago researchers are more aware of ethical research practices, and are implementing them into their studies. However, areas such as informed consent suffer from a lack of implementation in research studies. This is due to various factors, such as social media 'Terms of Service', challenges with large volumes of data, how far to take informed consent, and the definition of online informed consent. Researchers face a range of issues from digital rights to clear guidance. This paper discusses the findings of the survey questionnaire and explores how the findings affect researchers.",2-s2.0-84906070927,0,2014,First Monday,1

This paper develops a framework for studying the popularity dynamics of user-generated videos, presents a characterization of the popularity dynamics, and proposes a model that captures the key properties of these dynamics. We illustrate the biases that may be introduced in the analysis for some choices of the sampling technique used for collecting data; however, sampling from recently-uploaded videos provides a dataset that is seemingly unbiased. Using a dataset that tracks the views to a sample of recently-uploaded YouTube videos over the first eight months of their lifetime, we study the popularity dynamics. We find that the relative popularities of the videos within our dataset are highly non-stationary, owing primarily to large differences in the required time since upload until peak popularity is finally achieved, and secondly to popularity oscillation. We propose a model that can accurately capture the popularity dynamics of collections of recently-uploaded videos as they age, including key measures such as hot set churn statistics, and the evolution of the viewing rate and total views distributions over time.",2-s2.0-80053376307,0,2011,Performance Evaluation,1

Natural disasters that frequently occur, such as typhoons and earthquakes, heavily affect human activities in urban areas by causing severe congestion and economic loss. Predicting the delay in usual commuting activities of individuals following such disasters is crucial for managing urban systems. We propose a novel method that predicts such delay of individuals’ movements in several frequently occurring disasters using various types of features including the com-muters’ usual movement patterns, disaster information, and geospatial information of commuters’ locations. Our method predicts the irregularity of commuting activities in metropolitan Tokyo during several typhoons, and earthquakes, using Yahoo Japan’s GPS dataset of 1 million users. The results show that the irregularity of individuals’ movements are significantly more predictable than with previous models. Also, we are able to understand that commuters’ usual movement patterns, disaster intensity, and geospatial features including road density and population density are main factors that cause commuting delay following disasters.",2-s2.0-85015342797,0,2017,Journal of Disaster Research,1

Purpose - Online trust is one of the key obstacles to vendors succeeding on the internet medium; a lack of trust is likely to discourage online consumers from participating in e-commerce. This research aims to investigate how online consumers develop their initial trust and purchase intentions. The research in conducted in the context of Taiwanese online bookstores. Design/methodology/ approach - The research examines consumers' online initial trust by using four major categories of determinants: perceived technology, perceived risk, company competency, and trust propensity. It also investigates the impacts of both online initial trust and familiarity with online purchasing on purchase intention. The research model is statistically tested using the web sites of four online bookstores in Taiwan. The web site selected by each respondent is unfamiliar. Findings - It is found that perceived usefulness, perceived security, perceived privacy, perceived good reputation, and willingness to customise are the important antecedents to online initial trust. It is also discovered that different levels of trust propensity moderate perceptions toward the web site and online with respect to online initial trust, including perceived usefulness, perceived security, perceived privacy, perceived good reputation, and willingness to customise. Both online initial trust and familiarity with online purchasing have a positive impact on purchase intention. Originality/value - The research provides insight into the development of online initial trust by consumers, and the relationships between online initial trust and purchase intention.

An increasing number of people are using microblogs to broadcast their thoughts in real time as they watch televised political events. Microblogging social network sites (SNSs) such as Twitter generate a parallel stream of information and opinion. It is presumed that the additional content enhances the viewing experience, but our experiment explores the validity of this assumption. We studied how tweeting, or passively observing Twitter during a debate, influenced affect, recall and vote decision. For most measures, participants' average feeling and recall toward the candidates did not depend on Twitter activity, but Twitter activity did matter for vote choice. People who actively tweeted changed their voting choice to reflect the majority sentiment on Twitter. Results are discussed in terms of the possibility that active tweeting leads to greater engagement but that it may also make people more susceptible to social influence.

The automated analysis of social networks has become an important problem due to the proliferation of social networks, such as LiveJournal, Flickr and Facebook. The scale of these social networks is massive and continues to grow rapidly. An important problem in social network analysis is proximity estimation that infers the closeness of different users. Link prediction, in turn, is an important application of proximity estimation. However, many methods for computing proximity measures have high computational complexity and are thus prohibitive for large-scale link prediction problems. One way to address this problem is to estimate proximity measures via low-rank approximation. However, a single low-rank approximation may not be sufficient to represent the behavior of the entire network. In this paper, we propose Multi-Scale Link Prediction (MSLP), a framework for link prediction, which can handle massive networks. The basic idea of MSLP is to construct low-rank approximations of the network at multiple scales in an efficient manner. To achieve this, we propose a fast tree-structured approximation algorithm. Based on this approach, MSLP combines predictions at multiple scales to make robust and accurate predictions. Experimental results on real-life datasets with more than a million nodes show the superior performance and scalability of our method.",2-s2.0-84871049084,1,2012,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,1

When information is known only to friends in a social network, traditional crowdsourcing mechanisms struggle to motivate a large enough user population and to ensure accuracy of the collected information. We thus introduce friendsourcing, a form of crowdsourcing aimed at collecting accurate information available only to a small, socially-connected group of individuals. Our approach to friendsourcing is to design socially enjoyable interactions that produce the desired information as a side effect. We focus our analysis around Collabio, a novel social tagging game that we developed to encourage friends to tag one another within an online social network. Collabio encourages friends, family, and colleagues to generate useful information about each other. We describe the design space of incentives in social tagging games and evaluate our choices by a combination of usage log analysis and survey data. Data acquired via Collabio is typically accurate and augments tags that could have been found on Facebook or the Web. To complete the arc from data collection to application, we produce a trio of prototype applications to demonstrate how Collabio tags could be utilized: an aggregate tag cloud visualization, a personalized RSS feed, and a question and answer system. The social data powering these applications enables them to address needs previously difficult to support, such as question answering for topics comprehensible only to a few of a user's friends.",2-s2.0-77952941906,0,2010,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,1

BACKGROUND: The US Food and Drug Administration and the Department of Health and Human Services outline regulations allowing an exception from informed consent (EFIC) for research conducted in an emergency setting. Acute care clinical trials using EFIC must include community consultation and public disclosure (CC/PD) activities. We describe our experience using social media to facilitate the CC/PD process in two trauma resuscitation clinical trials. METHODS: We conducted local CC/PD activities for two multicenter trauma clinical trials, Pragmatic, Randomized Optimal Platelet and Plasma Ratios (PROPPR) and Prehospital Tranexamic Acid Use for Traumatic Brain Injury (ROC-TXA). As part of the CC/PD process, we developed research study advertisements using the social media Web site Facebook. The Facebook advertisements directed users to a regional study Web site that contained trial information. We targeted the advertisements to specific demographic users, in specific geographic areas. We analyzed the data using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: During the study periods, the PROPPR Facebook advertisement was displayed 5,001,520 times (12 displays per target population) with 374 individuals selecting the advertisement. The ROC-TXA Facebook advertisement was displayed 3,806,448 times (8 per target population) with 790 individuals selecting the advertisement. Respondents to both Facebook advertisements were mostly male (52.6%), with the highest proportion between the ages 15 years and 24 years (28.2%). Collectively, 26.9% of individuals that clicked on the Facebook advertisement spent more than 3 minutes on the study Web site (3-49 minutes). Commonly accessed Web pages were ""contact us"" (PROPPR, 5.5%; ROC-TXA, 7.7%), ""study-specific FAQs"" (PROPPR, 2.4%; ROC-TXA, 6.7%), and ""opt out of research"" (PROPPR, 2.5%; ROC-TXA, 3.8%). Of 51 total individuals viewing the opt out of research information (PROPPR, 19; ROC-TXA, 32), time spent on that specific page was modest (PROPPR, 62 seconds; ROC-TXA, 55 seconds), with no individuals requesting to opt out of either study participation. CONCLUSIONS: In clinical trauma trials using EFIC, social media may provide a viable option for facilitating the CC/PD process.

Search and browsing activity is known to be a valuable source of information about user's search intent. It is extensively utilized by most of modern search engines to improve ranking by constructing certain ranking features as well as by personalizing search. Personalization aims at two major goals: extraction of stable preferences of a user and specification and disambiguation of the current query. The common way to approach these problems is to extract information from user's search and browsing long-term history and to utilize short-term history to determine the context of a given query. Personalization of the web search for the first queries in new search sessions of new users is more difficult due to the lack of both long- and short-term data. In this paper we study the problem of short-term personalization. To be more precise, we restrict our attention to the set of initial queries of search sessions. These, with the lack of contextual information, are known to be the most challenging for short-term personalization and are not covered by previous studies on the subject. To approach this problem in the absence of the search context, we employ short-term browsing context. We apply a widespread framework for personalization of search results based on the re-ranking approach and evaluate our methods on the large scale data. The proposed methods are shown to significantly improve non-personalized ranking of one of the major commercial search engines. To the best of our knowledge this is the first study addressing the problem of short-term personalization based on recent browsing history. We find that performance of this re-ranking approach can be reasonably predicted given a query. When we restrict the use of our method to the queries with largest expected gain, the resulting benefit of personalization increases significantly.

The ubiquity of social networking sites (SNS) is astounding. As of 2016, Facebook had over 1.65 billion users. SNS is known for challenging conventional connotations of friendship by lumping all of one's social connections, including remote acquaintances, into one uniform friend category. Research suggests that social search is the future of online search and social search is seen as the online search for persons or information on persons. Based on only the structure of SNS, this paper devises a couple of exploration techniques to predict what strategies users are going to make friends on SNS in mobile environment. Essentially, there are two strategies for making friends on SNS in mobile environment: random and non-random (friends of friends) strategies. The non-random strategy means that new friends are selected in a friends-of-friends manner. Each SNS user can select randomly chosen target user, or neighbourhood search is done to develop a social network. This study develops logit models to capture the characteristics of these choice strategies. We conduct a series of experiments related to Facebook membership. Visualising how users are linked together or not is accessible via the Facebook application programming interface (API), so that we could crawl their Facebook accounts and extract their friends' data and access all their information under their agreement. In this study we obtained the users' permission to install an application within their accounts. The study analyses 226 Facebook users who totally have 37,571 friends and 607,802 relationships. The results significantly show that the number of individuals' friends, the value of closeness function, the betweenness value, and the clustering coefficient are the four important factors when an individual makes friends on Facebook. The accuracy of our models predicting the random or non-random strategies for making friends on Facebook is 84.5%. In addition, this paper significantly verifies the small-world phenomenon or six degrees of separation on Facebook. Implications for practitioners and academics are discussed.

But as mobile devices remain comparatively limited in terms of resources (e.g., computation, storage and battery life), current approaches for augmentation have advocated the integration of cloud servers as well as other nearby devices to provide scalable computation-And storage resources to mobile end users. A current solution is the so-called computation offloading, which is the most prominent strategy used in Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC) and its successor known as Mobile Edge Computing (MEC). While MCC and MEC are receiving increasing attention, current work is often not able to cope with the quickly and constantly changing context (e.g., intermittent connectivity) of mobile devices.

In the age of Big Data, the widespread use of location-awareness technologies has made it possible to collect spatio-temporal interaction data for analyzing flow patterns in both physical space and cyberspace. This research attempts to explore and interpret patterns embedded in the network of phone-call interaction and the network of phone-users' movements, by considering the geographical context of mobile phone cells. We adopt an agglomerative clustering algorithm based on a Newman-Girvan modularity metric and propose an alternative modularity function incorporating a gravity model to discover the clustering structures of spatial-interaction communities using a mobile phone dataset from one week in a city in China. The results verify the distance decay effect and spatial continuity that control the process of partitioning phone-call interaction, which indicates that people tend to communicate within a spatialproximity community.

This study conducted a stratified and cluster sampling on Chinese college students (N = 654) to investigate how SNS usages and social capital elicit impact on civic engagement. The results of path regression model shows that using SNS to meet new people is positively correlated with bonding and bridging social capital in the virtual world, using SNS to contact existing friends contributes to both bonding and bridging social capital in the real world. Online bonding and bridging social capital are positively related to online civic involvement, but not significantly related to offline civic behaviors. Offline bonding and bridging social capital are positively associated with offline civic participation, but not significantly related to online civic participation. The direct effect of using SNS to meet new social ties on civic engagement is partially mediated by social capital, whilst the effect of using SNS to connect friends on civic participation is completely mediated by social capital.",2-s2.0-84897414065,1,2014,Computers and Education,1

With the advent of Web 2.0, people became more eager to express and share their opinions on web regarding day-to-day activities and global issues as well. Evolution of social media has also contributed immensely to these activities, thereby providing us a transparent platform to share views across the world. These electronic Word of Mouth (eWOM) statements expressed on the web are much prevalent in business and service industry to enable customer to share his/her point of view. In the last one and half decades, research communities, academia, public and service industries are working rigorously on sentiment analysis, also known as, opinion mining, to extract and analyze public mood and views. In this regard, this paper presents a rigorous survey on sentiment analysis, which portrays views presented by over one hundred articles published in the last decade regarding necessary tasks, approaches, and applications of sentiment analysis. Several sub-tasks need to be performed for sentiment analysis which in turn can be accomplished using various approaches and techniques. This survey covering published literature during 2002-2015, is organized on the basis of sub-tasks to be performed, machine learning and natural language processing techniques used and applications of sentiment analysis.

521,15277,Pihlaja S.,'What about the wolves?': The use of scripture in YouTube arguments,"'What about the wolves?': The use of scripture in YouTube arguments. Reading and interpreting the Bible is an important practice in Evangelical Christian communities, both online and offline. Members of these communities employ biblical exegesis not only in convincing others about the validity of their beliefs, but also influencing the development of the social context in which they interact. Thus, reading and interpretation of the Bible serves both a theological purpose, allowing users to provide textual evidence for beliefs, and a practical social purpose, allowing users to map their own and others' actions onto biblical texts, either to condone or to condemn them. For users who hold the same belief about the importance of the Bible in making moral judgements, the biblical text can be a particularly useful tool to position oneself and one's actions. In this article, I employ concepts from positioning theory, to analyse how Evangelical Christian YouTube users read across the books of the Bible by treating similar uses of metaphorical language as interchangeable, and using them to position particular users and to make moral judgements about their actions. The analysis shows that reading and exegesis of scripture can be used in dynamic online environments to map characters and storylines from diverse biblical passages onto a particular online argument, providing a common resource for users from different backgrounds and contexts. Findings show that reading and interpretation of scriptures provide a powerful means of claiming authority for Evangelical Christians in the community, and are used to position oneself and one's actions, influencing the subsequent discourse and emerging social context.",2-s2.0-84981210526,1,2016,Language and Literature,1

Although the Internet has become ubiquitous in students' lives in school and at home, little is known about whether the Internet is used to close or reproduce educational inequalities. Drawing upon Bourdieu's notion of capital, there are two kinds of Internet use: capital-enhancing versus entertainment. This study used two big data analytic tools to examine interest in and usage of two highly popular websites that primarily target children and adolescents: KhanAcademy.org and CartoonNetwork.com. The former represents a capital-enhancing use of the Internet, while the latter represents an Internet use for entertainment. Data analysis revealed that high sociodemographic status was positively correlated with interest in Khan Academy, while low sociodemographic status was positively correlated with interest in Cartoon Network.

In this paper, we investigate a crucial aspect of the reputation mechanism design in electronic markets - the ability of buyers and sellers to revoke or mutually withdraw negative feedback and ratings. Based on recent changes in eBay feedback mechanism, we find that the two-way reputation system enables certain sellers to behave opportunistically by revoking negative feedbacks they receive. This makes the reputation system less effective in discerning the quality of sellers. We also find that changes in the reputation system have a significant influence on these sellers' behavior. After revoking is not possible on eBay, sellers put more efforts in the transactions. Our findings support the moral hazard assumption regarding seller's strategic behavior.

The temperature-salinity relationship is one of the most important characteristics used for identifying water masses in marine research. Nonetheless, it is not easy to search, compare or analyse the temperature-salinity characteristic efficiently in the ocean database of a wide ranging area. Since marine data are typically collected over a wide range area, how to represent, manage and share such data flexibly and responsively is a critical issue in marine research. Visualization techniques are powerful media for data presentation and knowledge discovery. The temperature-salinity relationship that signifies the characteristics of water mass is modelled in this study as a polynomial function whose coefficients can be estimated through statistical regression. Based on such representation, the distance between two temperature-salinity characteristics could be measured automatically, allowing the comparison of similar water masses for a wide range area to be efficiently performed. The proposed approach can effectively reduce the amount of computations by aggregating the data with seasonal and spatial variations, facilitating the comparison of different water masses through sampling the temperature-salinity characteristics without degrading their discriminating capabilities. With reduced scale data it becomes feasible to visualize or compare them in real time. This tool is helpful for querying geographic locations with similar temperature-salinity characteristic interactively and for tracking specific patterns of water masses, such as the Kuroshio near Taiwan or those in the South China Sea.",2-s2.0-84907968800,1,2014,"Terrestrial, Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences",1

Much research has focused on studying complex phenomena through their reflection in social media, from drawing neighborhood boundaries to inferring relationships between medicines and diseases. While it is generally recognized in the social sciences that such studies should be conditioned on gender, time and other confounding factors, few of the studies that attempt to extract information from social media actually condition on such factors due to the difficulty in extracting these factors from naturalistic data and the added complexity of including them in analyses. In this paper, we present a simple framework for specifying and implementing common social media analyses that makes it trivial to inspect and condition on contextual information. Our data model-discussion graphs-captures both the structural features of relationships inferred from social media as well as the context of the discussions from which they are derived, such as who is participating in the discussions, when and where the discussions are occurring, and what else is being discussed in conjunction. We implement our framework in a tool called DGT , and present case studies on its use. In particular, we show how analyses of neighborhoods and their boundaries based on geo-located social media data can have drastically varying results when conditioned on gender and time.

In this regard, it is crucial to integrate geo-tagged micro-data with more authoritative sources such as official landuse maps. This integration would benefit the urban research community by combining real time information about people activities and their spatial interaction with the synoptic view of physical infrastructure as depicted in official landuse maps.

Background: Calls to a telephone health helpline (THHL) have been previously evaluated for the ability to monitor specific syndromes, such as fever and influenza-like-illness or gastrointestinal illness. This method of surveillance has been shown to be highly correlated with traditional surveillance methods, and to have potential for early detection of community-based illness. Self-sampling, or having a person take his/her own nasal swab, has also proven successful as a useful method for obtaining a specimen, which may be used for respiratory virus detection. Methods: This study describes a self-swabbing surveillance system mediated by a nurse-led THHL in Ontario whereby syndromic surveillance concepts are used to recruit and monitor participants with influenza-like illness. Once recruited, participants collect a nasal specimen obtained by self-swabbing and submit for testing and laboratory confirmation. Enumeration of weekly case counts was used to evaluate the timeliness of the self-swabbing surveillance system through comparison to other respiratory virus and influenza surveillance systems in Ontario. The operational efficiency of the system was also evaluated. Results: The mean and median number of days between the day that a participant called the THHL, to the day a package was received at the laboratory for testing were approximately 10.4 and 8.6 days, respectively. The time between self-swab collection and package reception was 4.9 days on average, with a median of 4 days. The self-swabbing surveillance system adequately captured the 2014 influenza B season in a timely manner when compared to other Ontario-based sources of influenza surveillance data from the same year; however, the emergence of influenza B was not detected any earlier than with these other surveillance systems. Influenza A surveillance was also evaluated. Using the THHL self-swabbing system, a peak in the number of cases for influenza A was observed approximately one week after or during the same week as that reported by the other surveillance systems. Conclusion: This one-year pilot study suggests that the THHL self-swabbing surveillance system has significant potential as an adjunct tool for the surveillance of influenza viruses in Ontario.

Internet-mediated research has offered substantial advantages over traditional laboratory-based research in terms of efficiently and affordably allowing for the recruitment of large samples of participants for psychology studies. Core technical, ethical, and methodological issues have been addressed in recent years, but the important issue of participant dropout has received surprisingly little attention. Specifically, web-based psychology studies often involve undergraduates completing lengthy and time-consuming batteries of online personality questionnaires, but no known published studies to date have closely examined the natural course of participant dropout during attempted completion of these studies. The present investigation examined participant dropout among 1,963 undergraduates completing one of six web-based survey studies relatively representative of those conducted in university settings. Results indicated that 10% of participants could be expected to drop out of these studies nearly instantaneously, with an additional 2% dropping out per 100 survey items included in the study. For individual project investigators, these findings hold ramifications for study design considerations, such as conducting a priori power analyses. The present results also have broader ethical implications for understanding and improving voluntary participation in research involving human subjects. Nonetheless, the generalizability of these conclusions may be limited to studies involving similar design or survey content.

In particular it is becoming feasible that mobile devices can directly share content such as micro-blogs without Internet infrastructure. This offers advantages in terms of scalability, and for micro-blogs in particular, it offers the potential to provide content relevant to the end user without explicit subscriptions. To facilitate this, we propose a totally decentralised push-based scheme for intelligent micro-blogging from mobile devices based on opportunistic networking. This is achieved through mobile devices building interest profiles relevant to communities induced by frequent social interactions.

545,4265,"Bozzon A., Brambilla M., Ceri S.",Answering search queries with CrowdSearcher,"Answering search queries with CrowdSearcher. Web users are increasingly relying on social interaction to complete and validate the results of their search activities. While search systems are superior machines to get world-wide information, the opinions collected within friends and expert/local communities can ultimately determine our decisions: human curiosity and creativity is often capable of going much beyond the capabilities of search systems in scouting ""interesting"" results, or suggesting new, unexpected search directions. Such personalized interaction occurs in most times aside of the search systems and processes, possibly instrumented and mediated by a social network; when such interaction is completed and users resort to the use of search systems, they do it through new queries, loosely related to the previous search or to the social interaction. In this paper we propose CrowdSearcher, a novel search paradigm that embodies crowds as first-class sources for the information seeking process. CrowdSearcher aims at filling the gap between generalized search systems, which operate upon world-wide information - including facts and recommendations as crawled and indexed by computerized systems - with social systems, capable of interacting with real people, in real time, to capture their opinions, suggestions, emotions. The technical contribution of this paper is the discussion of a model and architecture for integrating computerized search with human interaction, by showing how search systems can drive and encapsulate social systems. In particular we show how social platforms, such as Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter, can be used for crowdsourcing search-related tasks; we demonstrate our approach with several prototypes and we report on our experiment upon real user communities.",2-s2.0-84860842462,0,2012,WWW'12 - Proceedings of the 21st Annual Conference on World Wide Web,1

547,9882,"Fang X., Hu P.J., Li Z.L., Tsai W.",Predicting adoption probabilities in social networks,"Predicting adoption probabilities in social networks. In a social network, adoption probability refers to the probability that a social entity will adopt a product, service, or opinion in the foreseeable future. Such probabilities are central to fundamental issues in social network analysis, including the influence maximization problem. In practice, adoption probabilities have significant implications for applications ranging from social network-based target marketing to political campaigns, yet predicting adoption probabilities has not received sufficient research attention. Building on relevant social network theories, we identify and operationalize key factors that affect adoption decisions: social influence, structural equivalence, entity similarity, and confounding factors. We then develop the locally weighted expectation-maximization method for Naïve Bayesian learning to predict adoption probabilities on the basis of these factors. The principal challenge addressed in this study is how to predict adoption probabilities in the presence of confounding factors that are generally unobserved. Using data from two large-scale social networks, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The empirical results also suggest that cascade methods primarily using social influence to predict adoption probabilities offer limited predictive power and that confounding factors are critical to adoption probability predictions.",2-s2.0-84877649558,1,2013,Information Systems Research,1

More than other information technology, social media has the potential to improve communication, participation, and collaboration between governments and citizens. The widespread use of Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, and blogs among citizens has forced government officials to use these technologies to reach citizens, interact with them, and legitimate policies and public decisions. Despite this great potential and the relevance of social media in today's society, there is still a relatively limited number of empirical studies that attempt to understand how governments are using these tools, particularly at the state and local levels. The main objective of this research is to understand how state governments are using Web 2.0 technologies and to provide some conceptual elements for future research in this area. Based on a longitudinal review of the 32 state Websites in Mexico and a more in-depth analysis of two cases, this chapter provides preliminary results on how state governments are using two of the most well known social media tools: Facebook and Twitter. The chapter highlights some differences and similarities among state governments.

Aim: There is evidence of significant growth in the engagement of UK health-care professionals with 'open' social media platforms, such as Twitter and LinkedIn. Social media communication provides many opportunities and benefits for medical education and interaction with patients and colleagues. This study was undertaken to evaluate the uptake of public social media membership and the characteristics of use of such media channels amongst contemporary UK consultant colorectal surgeons. Method: Colorectal surgeons were identified from the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland (ACPGBI) national registry of colorectal mortality outcomes and were cross-referenced with the General Medical Council (GMC) register. Individuals were identified by manual searching on a number of social media platforms. Matching accounts were then examined to confirm ownership and to evaluate key markers of use. Results: Six-hundred and eighteen individual consultant colorectal surgeons from 142 health authorities were studied (79.5% were ACPGBI members and 90.8% were male). Two-hundred and twenty-nine (37.1%) had LinkedIn profiles (37.7% male surgeons, 29.8% female surgeons; P = 0.2530). LinkedIn membership was significantly higher in ACPGBI members (P < 0.001) and in those with GMC registration before 1997 vs after this date (39% before 1997 vs 30% after 1997; P = 0.03). LinkedIn members had a mean of 62 connections (median = 22), and 19 (3.1%) surgeons had Twitter profiles with a mean of 82 (median = 16; range: 0-914) followers and their accounts were followed by a mean of 87 (median = 27; range: 0-642) persons.

The purpose of this paper is to present a methodological approach to detect an emerging hype in online communications. Design/methodology/approach – The paper combines Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) time series modelling and semantic co-word networks, and this combination of methods provides a view on the emergence and development of a hype at the level of mutual influences cross a heterogeneous set of newspaper and blog data. The subject scope of the paper is the climategate hype. The climategate hype was triggered by the online publication of a set of hacked e-mails belonging to climate researchers at the East Anglia University in November 2009.

Do political Web sites and blogs mobilize inactive citizens and make the public sphere more inclusive? The Myth of Digital Democracy reveals that, contrary to popular belief, the Internet has done little to broaden political discourse but in fact empowers a small set of elites--some new, but most familiar. Matthew Hindman argues that, though hundreds of thousands of Americans blog about politics, blogs receive only a miniscule portion of Web traffic, and most blog readership goes to a handful of mainstream, highly educated professionals. He shows how, despite the wealth of independent Web sites, online news audiences are concentrated on the top twenty outlets, and online organizing and fund-raising are dominated by a few powerful interest groups. Hindman tracks nearly three million Web pages, analyzing how their links are structured, how citizens search for political content, and how leading search engines like Google and Yahoo! funnel traffic to popular outlets. He finds that while the Internet has increased some forms of political participation and transformed the way interest groups and candidates organize, mobilize, and raise funds, elites still strongly shape how political material on the Web is presented and accessed.

Background: Emotional support has traditionally been conceived as something a breast cancer patient receives. However, this framework may obscure a more complex process, facilitated by the emerging social media environment, which includes the effects of composing and sending messages to others. Accordingly, this study explores the effects of expression and reception of emotional support messages in online groups and the importance of bonding as a mediator influencing the coping strategies of breast cancer patients. Methods: Data were collected as part of two National Cancer Institute-funded randomized clinical trials. Eligible subjects were within 2 months of diagnosis of primary breast cancer or recurrence. Expression and reception of emotionally supportive messages were tracked and coded for 237 breast cancer patients. Analysis resulted from merging 1) computer-aided content analysis of discussion posts, 2) action log analysis of system use, and 3) longitudinal survey data. Results: As expected, perceived bonding was positively related to all four coping strategies (active coping: β = 0.251, P = .000; positive reframing: β = 0.288, P = .000; planning: β = 0.213, P = .006; humor: β = 0.159, P = .009). More importantly, expression (γ = 0.138, P = .027), but not reception (γ = -0.018, P = .741), of emotional support increases perceived bonding, which in turn mediates the effects on patients' positive coping strategies. Conclusions: There is increasing importance for scholars to distinguish the effects of expression from reception to understand the processes involved in producing psychosocial benefits.

In contrast, the current study investigates patterns of consumption of Arab Spring-related content using a unique data set constructed by combining archived Twitter content with metadata drawn from the URL shortening service Bit.ly. This data set allows us to explore two critical research questions: First, were links posted to Twitter (among other platforms) followed primarily by individuals inside the affected country, within the broader Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region or by those outside the region and country? And second, who attracted more attention online: protesters and other nonelite citizens or traditional news organizations? Our findings suggest that the vast majority of attention to Arab Spring content came from outside of the MENA region and, furthermore, that mass media, rather than citizen media, overwhelmingly held the world's attention during the protests.

However, there are some challenges that hinder its ongoing advancements, one of them being the participants' recruitment. Ideally, the process of recruiting participants for a given sensing task should determine the optimal number of participants to answer the request and satisfying the quality needed with a certain guarantee on the confidence level in the sensing outcome. To address this challenge, we propose a novel group-based recruitment model based on genetic algorithm that selects the most appropriate group of participants using three types of parameters: AoI-related, device-related, and user-related. Furthermore, a new evaluation metric composed of the quality of information and the confidence level is suggested. The evolution of the provided quality by the available participants is analyzed and the least amount of resources to achieve the best possible quality is determined. Simulations are conducted using real-life dataset. The suggested system's performance is compared to an individual-based quality-assessment system that employs a greedy algorithm to recruit participants, which is the mostly used algorithm in the related work.",2-s2.0-84990036975,0,2016,Journal of Network and Computer Applications,1

Economic impacts of seasonal influenza vary across US counties, but little estimation has been conducted at the county level. This research computed annual economic costs of seasonal influenza for 3143 US counties based on Census 2010, identified inherent spatial patterns, and investigated cost-benefits of vaccination strategies. The computing model modified existing methods for national level estimation, and further emphasized spatial variations between counties, in terms of population size, age structure, influenza activity, and income level. Upon such a model, four vaccination strategies that prioritize different types of counties were simulated and their net returns were examined. The results indicate that the annual economic costs of influenza varied from $13.9 thousand to $957.5 million across US counties, with a median of $2.47 million. Prioritizing vaccines to counties with high influenza attack rates produces the lowest influenza cases and highest net returns. This research fills the current knowledge gap by downscaling the estimation to a county level, and adds spatial variability into studies of influenza economics and interventions. Compared to the national estimates, the presented statistics and maps will offer detailed guidance for local health agencies to fight against influenza.",2-s2.0-84861033023,1,2012,International Journal of Health Geographics,1

Sharing information and resources on the Internet has become an important activity for education. The use of ubiquitous devices makes it possible for learning participants to be engaged in an open and connected social environment, and also allows the learning activities to be performed at any time and any place. In this study, the discovery of correlation among shared resources is concentrated. A hypothetical scenario is considered that the information, such as photos and thoughts, is applicable to be shared with implicit context (i.e., geographical information) by learners through a practical implementation, PadSCORM, on a mobile device. Two major contributions are achieved. First, the correlations among resources are determined through usage experiences mining and geographical information adjustment. It then assists learners in filtering out redundant information by highlighting the significance of resources. Second, an intelligent searching algorithm is proposed to visualize adaptive routes to facilitate search process and to enrich the learning activity.

Merchants, as well as customers, have noticed the importance of online product reviews and numeric ratings in electronic commerce websites. It is valuable if merchants can discover some potential customer value from the sheer volume of data. This paper contributes a semantic text analytics approach that can dig out the customers’ most basic concerns about their online purchase choices. More specifically, based on the hypothesis that the product reviews and overall ratings estimated by same person in a tiny time interval have a great relevance, we dexterously utilize this relevance to realize the embedded customer value. In the proposed method, take the single lens reflex camera for example, an innovative aspect extraction method that comprehensively considers the product ontology and results of the topic modeling method latent Dirichlet allocation is applied. As a result, 8 specific aspects are identified from the experimental results. For each aspect, a self-contained review feature corpus is created as an extension of some seed terms. After aspect-based sentence segmentation and context-sensitive sentiments preprocessing, aspect-oriented sentiment analysis is applied. Multiple regression analysis is then used as a statistical measure to discover determinant aspects of overall ratings. The results reveal that cost performance, image quality and product integrity are the three most influential aspects.

Background: Insight into the quality of health care is important for any stakeholder including patients, professionals, and governments. In light of a patient-centered approach, it is essential to assess the quality of health care from a patient's perspective, which is commonly done with surveys or focus groups. Unfortunately, these ""traditional"" methods have significant limitations that include social desirability bias, a time lag between experience and measurement, and difficulty reaching large groups of people. Information on social media could be of value to overcoming these limitations, since these new media are easy to use and are used by the majority of the population. Furthermore, an increasing number of people share health care experiences online or rate the quality of their health care provider on physician rating sites. The question is whether this information is relevant to determining or predicting the quality of health care. Objective: The goal of our research was to systematically analyze the relation between information shared on social media and quality of care. Methods: We performed a scoping review with the following goals: (1) to map the literature on the association between social media and quality of care, (2) to identify different mechanisms of this relationship, and (3) to determine a more detailed agenda for this relatively new research area. A recognized scoping review methodology was used. We developed a search strategy based on four themes: social media, patient experience, quality, and health care. Four online scientific databases were searched, articles were screened, and data extracted. Results related to the research question were described and categorized according to type of social media. Furthermore, national and international stakeholders were consulted throughout the study, to discuss and interpret results. Results: Twenty-nine articles were included, of which 21 were concerned with health care rating sites. Several studies indicate a relationship between information on social media and quality of health care. However, some drawbacks exist, especially regarding the use of rating sites. For example, since rating is anonymous, rating values are not risk adjusted and therefore vulnerable to fraud. Also, ratings are often based on only a few reviews and are predominantly positive. Furthermore, people providing feedback on health care via social media are presumably not always representative for the patient population. Conclusions: Social media and particularly rating sites are an interesting new source of information about quality of care from the patient's perspective. This new source should be used to complement traditional methods, since measuring quality of care via social media has other, but not less serious, limitations. Future research should explore whether social media are suitable in practice for patients, health insurers, and governments to help them judge the quality performance of professionals and organizations.",2-s2.0-84897630541,1,2014,Journal of Medical Internet Research,1

An increasing number of customers make purchase decisions according to social media referrals. Social-network-based communication is becoming a necessity for companies to stay competitive. However, using social networks to effectively promote electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) remains challenging. Managers in general are unfamiliar with the key factors that can encourage online social network members to engage in eWOM. This study used social capital and self-determination theories to identify three social capital factors and two individual factors on eWOM. A survey of 238 social network users was conducted to determine the relative influence of these five factors on eWOM among the users. The partial least square analysis results indicate that tie strength and innovativeness directly influence eWOM in virtual social networks. Trust, shared language, and voluntary self-disclosure do not exhibit a significant influence.

We identify robust features of trust in social networks; these are features which are discriminating yet uncorrelated and can potentially be used to predict trust formation between agents in other social networks. The features we investigate are based on an agent’s individual properties as well as those based on the agent’s location within the network. In addition, we analyze features which take into account the agent’s participation in other social interactions within the same network. Three datasets were used in our study—Sony Online Entertainment’s EverQuest II game dataset, a large email network with sentiments and the publicly available Epinions dataset. The first dataset captures activities from a complex persistent game environment characterized by several types of in-game social interactions, whereas the second dataset has anonymized information about people’s email and instant messaging communication. We formulate the problem as one of the link predictions, intranetwork and internetwork, in social networks. We first build machine learning models and then perform an ablation study to identify robust features of trust. Results indicate that shared skills and interests between two agents, their level of activity and level of expertise are the top three predictors of trust in a social network. Furthermore, if only network topology information were available, then an agent’s propensity to connect or communicate, the cosine similarity between two agents and shortest distance between them are found to be the top three predictors of trust. In our study, we have identified the generic characteristics of the networks used as well as the features investigated so that they can be used as guidelines for studying the problem of predicting trust formation in other social networks.",2-s2.0-84945569463,1,2013,Social Network Analysis and Mining,1

Thus, daily search needs result in regular user engagement with a search engine. User engagement with web services was studied in various aspects, but there appears to be little work devoted to its regularity and periodicity. In this article, we study periodicity of user engagement with a popular search engine through applying spectrum analysis to temporal sequences of different engagement metrics. First, we found periodicity patterns of user engagement and revealed classes of users whose periodicity patterns do not change over a long period of time. In addition, we give an exhaustive analysis of the stability and quality of identified clusters. Second, we used the spectrum series as key metrics to evaluate search quality.

Recent research focusing on social factors affecting risk perceptions has suggested that social networks might help to explain why differences of opinion about climate change persist across segments of the lay public despite the scientific consensus. Even though concern for global warming in itself might seem irrelevant for most social ties, we show that it is significant enough to be reflected in the structure of social networks. To do this, we programmed a Facebook application that collected survey data on concerns and network data on friendships. We found that respondents tend to have friends with similar concerns as their own, the unconcerned respondents have fewer friends, and any two respondents who disagreed about the seriousness of global warming were less than half as likely to be friends. The results indicate that the structure of the social network may hinder changes in opinions, explaining why opinions persist despite the scientific consensus.

587,2488,"Yang C., Srinivasan P.",Translating surveys to surveillance on social media: Methodological challenges & solutions,"Translating surveys to surveillance on social media: Methodological challenges & solutions. Passive surveillance of preferences, opinions and behaviors on social media is becoming increasingly common. The gen- eral goal is to make inferences from observations collected from the numerous posts publicly available in blogs, mi- croblogs, and other social forums. A traditional approach for collecting observations is by querying a random (or conve- nience) sample of individuals with surveys. A wide variety of well respected survey instruments have been developed over many decades especially in social sciences. The question ad- dressed here is: how does one translate' a survey of inter- est into surveillance strategies on social media? Specifically, how does onefind the posts that could be interpreted as valid responses to the survey? Developing a general method- ology for translating a survey into social medial surveillance might further the inclusion of social media research into tra- ditional social science research. We propose a translation methodology using a well-reputed survey (the Satisfaction with Life Scale) as an example. A second methodological contribution that goes beyond the survey translation focus is a crowdsourcing approach, which we claim with reasonable confidence, finds close to all the relevant items in a dataset. This is different from the standard approach of asking work- ers to annotate all items in a small dataset. Our method supports more accurate evaluations (i.e., more precise recall calculations) as well as the development of larger training datasets. Finally the resulting surveillance method derived from the life satisfaction survey achieves recall, precision and F scores between 0.59 and 0.65. This is considerably bet- ter than standard methods using lexicons (precision around 0.16) or classifiers (precision, recall and F scores between 0.32 and 0.38).

Monitoring public perception of conservation is essential to ensure successful conservation outcomes. However, evaluating attitudes towards conservation projects presents daunting challenges because it is time consuming, expensive and open to social biases and small sample-size errors. Here, we present a recently developed approach to overcome these limitations – Internet-based methods - in particular offsite and onsite metrics. Offsite methods refer to Internet data mining tools that extract Internet search queries, such as Google Trends, while onsite methods refer to programmes that monitor traffic within websites, such as Google Analytics. We explore the potential of these methods rather than focus on the particular details of the case-studies provided to illustrate them. We used offsite methods to determine patterns in public interest in a reintroduced flagship species and in conservation awareness projects in the UK. We employed onsite metrics to assess the success in communicating a conservation outcome and to evaluate the success in online public engagement of a conservation NGO. Our results indicate that both offsite and onsite metrics are able to track changes in public interest across time and space. In particular, onsite metrics provide high levels of temporal and spatial resolution with a high degree of flexibility.

One of the modules constituting the smart community is an intelligent transportation system, in which various sensors track movements of people and vehicles in real time to optimize migration pathways or means. Social media have the potential to serve as sensors, since people often post transportation information on such media. This paper presents a feasibility study on detecting information, focusing on train status information, by exploiting Twitter as a sensor. We dealt with two issues: (1) for the ambiguity of textual information expressed in tweets, we utilized heuristic rules in text manipulation, and (2) for the differences in the numbers of tweets among train lines, we optimized parameter values in statistical analysis for each train line. The experimental results show that the F-measure of detecting the information was more than 0.85 and the time taken to detect the information was less than 4 minutes.

One way to think about social context is as a sample of alters. To understand individual action, therefore, it matters greatly where these alters may be coming from, and how they are connected. According to one vision, connections among alters induce local dependencies—emergent rules of social interaction that generate endogenously the observed network structure of social settings. Social selection is the decision of interest in this perspective. According to a second vision, social settings are collections of social foci—physical or symbolic locales where actors meet. Because alters are more likely to be drawn from focused sets, shared social foci are frequently considered as the main generators of network ties, and hence of setting structure. Affiliation to social foci is the decision of central interest in this second view. In this paper we show how stochastic actor–oriented models (SAOMs) originally derived for studying the dynamics of multiple networks may be adopted to represent and examine these interconnected systems of decisions (selection and affiliation) within a unified analytical framework. We illustrate the empirical value of the model in the context of a longitudinal sample of adolescent participating in the Glasgow Teenage Friends and Lifestyle Study.

This paper reviews these conceptual bases of human research ethics and gives examples of their consideration in the literature of research into learning and teaching with Web 2.0. The paper goes on to give an account of reflective practice by two academic developers in relation to ethical issues they encountered, considered and addressed in eight case studies, which were part of a larger multi-university Australian study into learning and teaching with Web 2.0. The paper concludes that the human research ethics approval process needs to be understood as a series of measures that are important to protect not only the students but also the teacher-researchers and their institutions when doing learning and teaching research with Web 2.0. This understanding is important for educators and as well for educational developers, educational technologists and human research ethics review committees (also known as institutional review boards).",2-s2.0-84887394752,1,2013,Journal of Computing in Higher Education,1

A simile is a comparison between two essentially unlike things, such as ""Jane swims like a dolphin"". Similes often express a positive or negative sentiment toward something, but recognizing the polarity of a simile can depend heavily on world knowledge. For example, ""memory like an elephant"" is positive, but ""memory like a sieve "" is negative. Our research explores methods to recognize the polarity of similes on Twitter.

Retrieving information from Twitter is always challenging due to its large volume, inconsistent writing and noise. Most existing information retrieval (IR) and text mining methods focus on term-based approach, but suffers from the problems of terms variation such as polysemy and synonymy. This problem deteriorates when such methods are applied on Twitter due to the length limit. Over the years, people have held the hypothesis that pattern-based methods should perform better than term-based methods as it provides more context, but limited studies have been conducted to support such hypothesis especially in Twitter. This paper presents an innovative framework to address the issue of performing IR in microblog. The proposed framework discover patterns in tweets as higher level feature to assign weight for low-level features (i.e. terms) based on their distributions in higher level features. We present the experiment results based on TREC11 microblog dataset and shows that our proposed approach significantly outperforms term-based methods Okapi BM25, TF-IDF and pattern based methods, using precision, recall and F measures.",2-s2.0-84958093548,0,2012,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),1

Along with the rapid development of social networks, social network worms have constituted one of the major internet security problems. The root of worm is the inevitable software vulnerability during the design and implementation process of software. So it is hard to completely avoid worms in the existing software engineering systems. Due to lots of bandwidth consumption, the patch cannot be transmitted simultaneously by the network administrator to all hosts. This paper studies how to prevent the propagation of social network worms through the immunization of key nodes. Unlike existing containment models for worm propagation, a novel immunization strategy is proposed based on network vertex influence. The strategy selects the critical vertices in the whole network. Then the immunization is applied on the selected vertices to achieve the maximal effect of worm containment with minimal cost. Different algorithms are implemented to select vertices. Simulation experiments are presented to analyze and evaluate the performance of different algorithms.",2-s2.0-84939502615,0,2015,China Communications,1

Stylistic variation in online social media writing is well attested: for example, geographical analysis of the social media service Twitter has replicated isoglosses for many known lexical variables from speech, while simultaneously revealing a wealth of new geographical lexical variables, including emoticons, phonetic spellings, and phrasal abbreviations. However, less is known about the social role of variation in online writing. This article examines online writing variation in the context of audience design, focusing on affordances offered by Twitter that allow users to modulate a message's intended audience. We find that the frequency of nonstandard lexical variables is inversely related to the size of the intended audience: as writers target smaller audiences, the frequency of lexical variables increases. In addition, these variables are more often used in messages that are addressed to individuals who are known to be geographically local. This phenomenon holds not only for geographically differentiated lexical variables, but also for nonstandard variables that are widely used throughout the United States. These findings suggest that users of social media are attuned to both the nature of their audience and the social meaning of lexical variation and that they customize their self-presentation accordingly.

Motivated by the lack of knowledge of what factors deterring Internet users from adopting the Internet shopping in developing cultures, this investigation is therefore intended to underline the possible factors responsible for their deterrence. To achieve this objective, a model was proposed by involving factors established in literature as key potential drivers for predicating individuals' behavioral intention to adopt new technologies. The proposed factors were drawn from popular IS/IT adoption theories, namely perceived ease-of-use, perceived usefulness, perceived compatibility, social influence, trust, perceived risk, privacy, security, Internet shopping anxiety, Internet self-efficacy and price. Gender moderating influence was investigated in the conceptualized relationships between proposed factors and behavioral intention.This study was implemented by collecting data through a self-administered questionnaire from a broad diversity of Jordanian Internet users. Analyzing the data which consists of 261 valid datasets was accomplished by using WarpPLS 4.0. The results provide significant statistical evidence in support of all the factors hypothesized to influence behavioral intention to adopt with the exception of three factors: perceived risk, privacy and security. Furthermore, the gender was found to moderate the relationships between five of the proposed factors (perceived ease-of-use, social influence, trust, perceived risk, privacy) and behavioral intention. This study has also revealed some differences between online shoppers (based on prior literature and results) and non-shoppers.

Furthermore, these studies typically focus on aggregated statistics or on models for individual users, and do not capture the inter-node relationships. We empirically studied some statistical properties of internode relationships, and proposed a universal scheme, named A-Scheme, to improve existing probabilistic routing approaches. In most of those approaches, decision is made using a static method. However, we claim that judging threshold varies according to activity is more suitable.

Second, we have independent raters separately code front-page election stories and headlines. Third, we tabulate the number of electoral endorsements that newspapers give to each side of politics in federal elections. Overall, we find that the Australian media are quite centrist, with very few outlets being statistically distinguishable from the middle of Australian politics. It is possible that this is because of the lack of competition in the Australian media market.

In this paper, a multiobjective biogeography based optimization algorithm with decomposition (MBBOD) is proposed to solve community detection problem in dynamic networks. In the proposed algorithm, the decomposition mechanism is adopted to optimize two evaluation objectives named modularity and normalized mutual information simultaneously, which measure the quality of the community partitions and temporal cost respectively. A novel sorting strategy for multiobjective biogeography based optimization is presented for comparing quality of habitats to get species counts. In addition, problem-specific migration and mutation model are introduced to improve the effectiveness of the new algorithm.

A meme's mutation rate characterizes the population distribution of its variants, in accordance with the Yule process. Variants further apart in the diffusion cascade have greater edit distance, as would be expected in an iterative, imperfect replication process. Some text sequences can confer a replicative advantage; these sequences are abundant and transfer ""laterally"" between different memes. Subpopulations of the social network can preferentially transmit a specific variant of a meme if the variant matches their beliefs or culture.

Objective: The aim of the study was to analyze Google search data to assess the scope and breadth of information seeking on dabbing. Methods: Google Trends data about dabbing and related topics (eg, electronic nicotine delivery system [ENDS], also known as e-cigarettes) in the United States between January 2004 and December 2015 were collected by using relevant search terms such as ""dab rig."" The correlation between dabbing (including topics: dab and hash oil) and ENDS (including topics: vaping and e-cigarette) searches, the regional distribution of dabbing searches, and the impact of cannabis legalization policies on geographical location in 2015 were analyzed. Results: Searches regarding dabbing increased in the United States over time, with 1,526,280 estimated searches during 2015. Searches for dab and vaping have very similar temporal patterns, where the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) is .992 (P<.001). Similar phenomena were also obtained in searches for hash oil and e-cigarette, in which the corresponding PCC is .931 (P<.001).

Link prediction is one of the most fundamental problems in graph modeling and mining. It has been studied in a wide range of scenarios, from uncovering missing links between different entities in databases, to recommending relations between people in social networks. In this problem, we wish to predict unseen links in a growing target network by exploiting existing structures in source networks. Most of the existing methods often assume that abundant links are available in the target network to build a model for link prediction. However, in many scenarios, the target network may be too sparse to enable robust inference process, which makes link prediction challenging with the paucity of link data. On the other hand, in many cases, other (more densely linked) auxiliary networks can be available that contains similar link structure relevant to that in the target network. The linkage information in the existing networks can be used in conjunction with the node attribute information in both networks in order to make more accurate link recommendations. Thus, this paper proposes the use of learning methods to perform link inference by transferring the link information from the source network to the target network. We also note that the source network may contain the link information irrelevant to the target network. This leads to cross-network bias between the networks, which makes the link model built upon the source network misaligned with the link structure of the target network. Therefore, we re-sample the source network to rectify such cross-network bias by maximizing the cross-network relevance measured by the node attributes, as well as preserving as rich link information as possible to avoid the loss of source link structure caused by the re-sampling algorithm. The link model based on the re-sampled source network can make more accurate link predictions on the target network with aligned link structures across the networks. We present experimental results illustrating the effectiveness of the approach.",2-s2.0-84946195718,1,2015,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,1

Background: Sixty percent of Internet users report using the Internet to look for health information. Social media sites are emerging as a potential source for online health information. However, little is known about how people use social media for such purposes. Objectives: The purpose of this study was two-fold: (1) to establish the frequency of various types of online health-seeking behaviors, and (2) to identify correlates of 2 health-related online activities, social networking sites (SNS) for health-related activities and consulting online user-generated content for answers about health care providers, health facilities, or medical treatment. Methods: The study consisted of a telephone survey of 1745 adults who reported going online to look for health-related information. Four subscales were created to measure use of online resources for (1) using SNS for health-related activities; (2) consulting online rankings and reviews of doctors, hospitals or medical facilities, and drugs or medical treatments; (3) posting a review online of doctors, hospitals or medical facilities, and drugs or medical treatments, and (4) posting a comment or question about health or medical issues on various social media. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed. Results: Respondents consulted online rankings or reviews (41.15%), used SNS for health (31.58%), posted reviews (9.91%), and posted a comment, question, or information (15.19%). Respondents with a chronic disease were nearly twice as likely to consult online rankings (odds ratio [OR] 2.09, 95% CI 1.66-2.63, P<.001).

Internet - based social media technologies provide a variety of contexts for people to engage in social interaction; they provide different types of relationships and a variety of potential risks. This paper proposes a theoretical model which integrates theories of trust, social capital and social exchange to explain people's engagement with these technologies. Mayers, Davis and Schoorman's (1995) influential theory of trust and risk taking provides a framework for understanding the factors which influence an individual's evaluation of the risks of engaging in activities where success is dependent on another actor. A limitation of Trust theory is that it does not explain the role of perceived costs and rewards as factors influencing people's propensity to engage in social activities. Social Exchange Theory and the concept of Social Capital provide a framework for this analysis. This paper illustrates how the integration of these concepts can provide a model of social behaviour which can used to interpret the uptake of a range of internet-mediated relationships such as online auctions, online communities of practice and social networking applications. The theoretical model provides conceptual framework which can guide designers of and social media strategies and developers of applications in the production of engaging user experiences.",2-s2.0-84930975693,1,2015,International Journal of Interdisciplinary Studies in Communication,1

The discovery of patterns and events in the physical world by analysis of multiple streams of sensor data can provide benefit to society in more than just surveillance applications by focusing on automated means for social scientists, anthropologists and marketing experts to detect macroscopic trends and changes in the general population. This goal complements analogous efforts in documenting trends in the digital world, such as those in social media monitoring. In this paper we show how the contents of a street webcam, processed with state-of-the-art deep networks, can provide information about patterns in clothing and their relation to weather information. In particular, we analyze a large time series of street webcam images, using a deep network trained for garment detection, and demonstrate how the garment distribution over time significantly correlates to weather and temporal patterns. Finally, we additionally provide a new and improved labelled dataset of garments for training and benchmarking purposes, reporting 58.19% overall accuracy on the ACS test set, the best performance yet obtained.",2-s2.0-84978924738,1,2016,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),1

The temporal statistics exhibited by written correspondence appear to be media dependent, with features which have so far proven difficult to characterize. We explain the origin of these difficulties by disentangling the role of spontaneous activity from decision-based prioritizing processes in human dynamics, clocking all waiting times through each agent's ""proper time"" measured by activity. This unveils the same fundamental patterns in written communication across all media (letters, email, sms), with response times displaying truncated power-law behavior and average exponents near -32. When standard time is used, the response time probabilities are theoretically predicted to exhibit a bimodal character, which is empirically borne out by our newly collected years-long data on email.

In-auction fraud differs from pre- and post-auction fraud in that it happens in the bidding period of an active auction. Since the in-auction fraud strategies are subtle and complex, it makes the fraudulent behavior more difficult to discover.

Self-reported data are regarded by medical researchers as invalid and less reliable than data produced by experts in clinical settings, yet individuals can increasingly contribute personal information to medical research through a variety of online platforms. In this article we examine this ‘participatory turn’ in healthcare research, which claims to challenge conventional delineations of what is valid and reliable for medical practice, by using aggregated self-reported experiences from patients and ‘pre-patients’ via the internet. We focus on 23andMe, a genetic testing company that collects genetic material and self-reported information about disease from its customers. Integral to this research method are relations of trust embedded in the information exchange: trust in customers’ data; trust between researchers/company and research subjects; trust in genetics; trust in the machine. We examine the performative dimension of these trust relations, drawing on Shapin and Schaffer's (1985) discussion of how material, literary and social technologies are used in research in order to establish trust. Our scepticism of the company's motives for building trust with the self-reporting consumer forces us to consider our own motives. How does the use of customer data for research purposes by 23andMe differ from the research practices of social scientists, especially those who also study digital traces? By interrogating the use of self-reported data in the genetic testing context, we examine our ethical responsibilities in studying the digital selves of others using internet methods.

Online traces of human activity offer novel opportunities to study the dynamics of complex knowledge exchange networks, in particular how emergent patterns of collective attention determine what new information is generated and consumed. Can we measure the relationship between demand and supply for new information about a topic? We propose a normalization method to compare attention bursts statistics across topics with heterogeneous distribution of attention. Through analysis of a massive dataset on traffic to Wikipedia, we find that the production of new knowledge is associated to significant shifts of collective attention, which we take as proxy for its demand. This is consistent with a scenario in which allocation of attention toward a topic stimulates the demand for information about it, and in turn the supply of further novel information. However, attention spikes only for a limited time span, during which new content has higher chances of receiving traffic, compared to content created later or earlier on. Our attempt to quantify demand and supply of information, and our finding about their temporal ordering, may lead to the development of the fundamental laws of the attention economy, and to a better understanding of social exchange of knowledge information networks.",2-s2.0-84930226001,1,2015,Scientific Reports,1

We tackle the problem of user de-anonymization in social networks characterized by scale-free relationships between users. The network is modeled as a graph capturing the impact of power-law node degree distribution, which is a fundamental and quite common feature of social networks. Using this model, we present a de-anonymization algorithm that exploits an initial set of users, called seeds, that are known a priori. By employing the bootstrap percolation theory and a novel graph slicing technique, we develop a rigorous analysis of the proposed algorithm under asymptotic conditions. Our analysis shows that large inhomogeneities in the node degree lead to a dramatic reduction in the size of the seed set that is necessary to successfully identify all the other users. We characterize this set size when seeds are properly selected based on the node degree as well as when seeds are uniformly distributed. We prove that, given n nodes, the number of seeds required for network de-anonymization can be as small as nϵ , for any small ϵ >0. In addition, we discuss the complexity of our de-anonymization algorithm and validate our results through numerical experiments on a real social network graph.",2-s2.0-84964597381,1,2016,IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking,1

Previous studies of information diffusion or behavior spread over social networks have mostly focused on diffusion models and analysis of virtual interaction between online users, and very few of them focus on the propagation of real world activities in these social networks. To address this problem, we use data obtained from the Chinese largest recommendation social network - Douban, and study how the offline activities spread from one user to another through Douban. By using cascading subgraphs and diffusion trees, we break a whole cascade into local subgraphs. After analyzing the activities of about 1.47 million users, we observe the statistical and topological characteristics of these local cascading subgraphs. Next, we find the size and degree distributions of these cascading subgraphs and several common patterns of topology of local cascades. Moreover, we also have some other interesting discoveries, like the relation between the number of initial adopters and the final cascade size, and the underlying influences driving user behaviors.

We manipulate the level of market competition and the nature of the social network behind the feedback system and study the affect on trust, trustworthiness, and market efficiency. We find that competition in strangers networks, where market encounters are one-shot and reputation information is communicated through outside parties, improves trust, trustworthiness, and market efficiency. The efficiency advantage that partners networks, where a buyer can maintain a repeated relationship with a seller, have over strangers networks largely vanishes with the introduction of competition. This is because the difference in the pattern of social networking largely disappears. Overall, encouraging competition leads to more effective feedback systems in Internet markets.

ENDS awareness increased from 16% to 58% from 2009 to 2011, and use increased from 1% to 6%. The majority of users were current or former smokers. Many users found ENDS satisfying, and some engaged in dual use of ENDS and other tobacco. No longitudinal studies examined whether ENDS serve as 'gateways' to future tobacco use. Common reasons for using ENDS were quitting smoking and using a product that is healthier than cigarettes. Self-reported survey data and prospective trials suggest that ENDS might help cigarette smokers quit, but no randomised controlled trials with probability samples compared ENDS with other cessation tools.

Human behaviour is highly individual by nature, yet statistical structures are emerging which seem to govern the actions of human beings collectively. Here we search for universal statistical laws dictating the timing of human actions in communication decisions. We focus on the distribution of the time interval between messages in human broadcast communication, as documented in Twitter, and study a collection of over 160,000 tweets for three user categories: personal (controlled by one person), managed (typically PR agency controlled) and bot-controlled (automated system). To test our hypothesis, we investigate whether it is possible to differentiate between user types based on tweet timing behaviour, independently of the content in messages. For this purpose, we developed a system to process a large amount of tweets for reality mining and implemented two simple probabilistic inference algorithms: 1. a naive Bayes classifier, which distinguishes between two and three account categories with classification performance of 84.6% and 75.8%, respectively and 2. a prediction algorithm to estimate the time of a user's next tweet with an R2 ≈0.7. Our results show that we can reliably distinguish between the three user categories as well as predict the distribution of a user's inter-message time with reasonable accuracy. More importantly, we identify a characteristic power-law decrease in the tail of inter-message time distribution by human users which is different from that obtained for managed and automated accounts. This result is evidence of a universal law that permeates the timing of human decisions in broadcast communication and extends the findings of several previous studies of peer-to-peer communication.",2-s2.0-84879739780,1,2013,PLoS ONE,1

On the surface, this might suggest that human mobility patterns are highly irregular and impossible to predict. Drawing on a detailed multisensory positioning data set, we replicate earlier cell tower based predictability analyses with granular spatial and temporal multisensory data, and demonstrate a spatial resolution dependence of entropy, while reinforcing the claims of inherent predictability of human mobility advanced in early works. We demonstrate that mobility entropies reported with GPS data remain essentially unchanged with pruning of noisy GPS signals, lending additional credence to our methodology. We further compare cell tower results to those from WiFi-based localization for exactly the same time periods and participants, and demonstrate that the finer spatial resolution of WiFi also results in reported entropy exceeding that from cell tower traces, indicating that the resolution dependence observed for GPS data is not entirely due to GPS noise or discretization representation.

Data was collected from 748 fans of 15 Facebook brand fan pages of five fast food brands operating in three different countries. Structural equation modelling was used to test the hypothesis. Results revealed that modes of interaction significantly mediate the relationship between personality traits and social media engagement behaviors. While culture moderates this relationship.

Overweight or obesity is prevalent among college students and many gain weight during this time. Traditional face-to-face weight loss interventions have not worked well in this population. Facebook is an attractive tool for delivering weight loss interventions for college students because of its popularity, potential to deliver strategies found in successful weight loss interventions, and ability to support ongoing adaptation of intervention content. Objective: The objective of this study was to describe participant exposure to a Facebook page designed to deliver content to overweight/obese college students in a weight loss randomized controlled trial (N=404) and examine participant engagement with behavior change campaigns for weight loss delivered via Facebook. Methods: The basis of the intervention campaign model were 5 self-regulatory techniques: intention formation, action planning, feedback, goal review, and self-monitoring. Participants were encouraged to engage their existing social network to meet their weight loss goals. A health coach moderated the page and modified content based on usage patterns and user feedback. Quantitative analyses were conducted at the Facebook post- and participant-level of analysis. Participant engagement was quantified by Facebook post type (eg, status update) and interaction (eg, like) and stratified by weight loss campaign (sequenced vs nonsequenced). A subset of participants were interviewed to evaluate the presence of passive online engagement or ""lurking."" Results: The health coach posted 1816 unique messages to the study's Facebook page over 21 months, averaging 3.45 posts per day (SD 1.96, range 1-13). In all, 72.96% (1325/1816) of the posts were interacted with at least once (eg, liked). Of these, approximately 24.75% (328/1325) had 1-2 interactions, 23.39% (310/1325) had 3-5 interactions, 25.13% (333/1325) had 6-8 interactions, and 41 posts had 20 or more interactions (3.09%, 41/1325). There was significant variability among quantifiable (ie, visible) engagement. Of 199 participants in the final intervention sample, 32 (16.1%) were highly active users and 62 (31.2%) never visibly engaged with the intervention on Facebook. Polls were the most popular type of post followed by photos, with 97.5% (79/81) and 80.3% (386/481) interacted with at least once. Participants visibly engaged less with posts over time (partial r=-.33; P<.001). Approximately 40% of the participants interviewed (12/29, 41%) reported passively engaging with the Facebook posts by reading but not visibly interacting with them. Conclusions: Facebook can be used to remotely deliver weight loss intervention content to college students with the help of a health coach who can iteratively tailor content and interact with participants. However, visible engagement with the study's Facebook page was highly variable and declined over time. Whether the level of observed engagement is meaningful in terms of influencing changes in weight behaviors and outcomes will be evaluated at the completion of the overall study.",2-s2.0-84906243631,0,2014,Journal of Medical Internet Research,1

Purpose: Amazon Mechanical Turk is an increasingly popular data source in the organizational psychology research community. This paper presents an evaluation of MTurk and provides a set of practical recommendations for researchers using MTurk. Design/Methodology/Approach: We present an evaluation of methodological concerns related to the use of MTurk and potential threats to validity inferences. Based on our evaluation, we also provide a set of recommendations to strengthen validity inferences using MTurk samples. Findings: Although MTurk samples can overcome some important validity concerns, there are other limitations researchers must consider in light of their research objectives. Researchers should carefully evaluate the appropriateness and quality of MTurk samples based on the different issues we discuss in our evaluation. Implications: There is not a one-size-fits-all answer to whether MTurk is appropriate for a research study. The answer depends on the research questions and the data collection and analytic procedures adopted. The quality of the data is not defined by the data source per se, but rather the decisions researchers make during the stages of study design, data collection, and data analysis. Originality/Value: The current paper extends the literature by evaluating MTurk in a more comprehensive manner than in prior reviews. Past review papers focused primarily on internal and external validity, with less attention paid to statistical conclusion and construct validity—which are equally important in making accurate inferences about research findings. This paper also provides a set of practical recommendations in addressing validity concerns when using MTurk.",2-s2.0-84976439423,0,2017,Journal of Business and Psychology,1

Previous research has consistently documented a hostile media effect in which people see bias in balanced reporting on political controversies. In the contemporary fragmented media environment, partisan news outlets intentionally report political news from ideological perspectives, raising the possibility that ideologically biased news may cause viewers to become increasingly suspicious of and antagonistic toward news media-which we call oppositional media hostility. However, the fragmented media environment also gives television viewers ample opportunities to tune out news outlets with which they disagree as well as the news altogether, and this should moderate oppositional media hostility. We investigate the effects of partisan news shows on media perceptions across six laboratory-based experiments. We find that counterattitudinal news programming is more likely to induce hostile media perceptions than proattitudinal programming, but that the presence of choice blunts oppositional media hostility. We explore possible mechanisms that underlie the moderating effects of selective exposure.",2-s2.0-84863413507,1,2012,Journal of Politics,1

While various book reviews are frequently published in various sources (e. g., IEEE Software Bookshelf), there are no studies to classify UML books into meaningful categories. Such a classification can help researchers in the area to identify trends and also reveal the level of activity in each sub-area of UML. The statistical survey reported in this article intends to be a first step in classification and trend analysis of the UML books published from 1997 to 2009. The study also sheds light on the quantity of books published in different focus areas (e. g., UML's core concepts, patterns, tool support, Object Constraint Language and Model-Driven Architecture) and also on different application domains (e. g., database modeling, web applications, and real-time systems). The trends of book publications in each sub-area of UML are also used to track the level of maturity, to identify possible Hype cycles and also to measure knowledge demand in each area.",2-s2.0-84860480028,1,2012,Software and Systems Modeling,1

Intending to identify why, how, and for what outcome users use SNS, this study contributes to the body of knowledge on SNS by analyzing how motivation, participation, and performance are related to each other in the SNS context. Drawing on a theoretical perspective of the motivation-participation-performance framework, we identify four significant why motivations (i.e., vertical social, horizontal social, hedonic, and utilitarian motivations), two main ways (how) of participation (i.e., sharing and collaboration), and two ultimate benefits (for what outcome) of SNS use (i.e., personal and job performance). The analyzed results of empirical data collected from SNS users indicate that the identified motivations significantly influence participation in sharing and collaboration activities on SNS and that SNS participation significantly affects personal and professional/job-related performance.

657,12807,"Gu Y., Chen T., Sun Y., Wang B.",Ideology detection for twitter users via link analysis,"Ideology detection for twitter users via link analysis. The problem of ideology detection is to study the latent (political) placement for people, which is traditionally studied on politicians according to their voting behaviors. Recently, more and more studies begin to address the ideology detection problem for ordinary users based on their online behaviors that can be captured by social media, e.g., Twitter. As far as we are concerned, the vast majority of the existing methods on ideology detection on social media have oversimplified the problem as a binary classification problem (i.e., liberal vs. conservative). Moreover, though social links can play a critical role in deciding one’s ideology, most of the existing work ignores the heterogeneous types of links in social media. In this paper we propose to detect numerical ideology positions for Twitter users, according to their follow, mention, and retweet links to a selected set of politicians. A unified probabilistic model is proposed that can (1) integrate heterogeneous types of links together in determining people’s ideology, and (2) automatically learn the quality of each type of links in deciding one’s ideology. Experiments have demonstrated the advantages of our model in terms of both ranking and political leaning classification accuracy.",2-s2.0-85022343547,1,2017,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),1

Social networking sites offer individuals an opportunity to document and share information about themselves, as well as engaging in social browsing to learn about others. As a micro-blogging site within which users often share information publicly, Twitter may be a particularly suitable venue that can help satisfy both of these motivations. This study investigates how viewers react to disclosure of intimate information on Twitter. Specifically, the impact of disclosure intimacy is studied on attention that viewers pay to a Twitter page, reduction in their uncertainty about the attributes of the page owner, and their interpersonal attraction to the owner of the page. A total of 618 adult online panel members viewed one of six Twitter pages that contained either low-intimacy or high-intimacy tweets. Analyses indicated that viewers exposed to the Twitter pages containing high-intimate information paid more attention to the pages, were more confident about the attributions they could make about the page owner, yet were less willing to pursue further socialization with the page owner. Furthermore, attributional confidence mediated and perceived similarity moderated the relationship between disclosure intimacy and interpersonal attraction. This interaction between disclosure intimacy and perceived similarity was such that viewers who considered the page owner to be similar (dissimilar) to themselves were more (less) socially attracted to page owners who disclosed intimate information. These findings suggest that while intimate information shared on a Twitter page draws attention, this does not necessarily result in further socialization with the page owner - an effect we named as the ""rubbernecking effect"" of intimate information.",2-s2.0-84941112603,1,2015,"Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking",1

Online social networks have changed the ways in which people communicate and interact, and have also impacted the business landscape. One recent trend is firms using online social networks as a part of the job hiring process. Firms scrutinize potential employees using their social network profiles, sometimes even seeking access to restricted parts of the profile, for example by demanding applicants to hand over their passwords. We explore the key criteria and profile components that affect perceptions about a user. Our results are based on datasets consisting of reports of participants who actually took part in a task of evaluating candidates. Participants volunteered their Facebook profiles and CVs, to be examined by other participants who provided a detailed report about their job-suitability. We find that in screening based on social network profiles, a profile owner's education and demographic traits correlate with their job-suitability rating. Many profile components, including textual posts, pictures, likes, and even the friend list, relate to an applicant's perceived job-suitability. Further, diverse criteria play a role in forming job-suitability perceptions, including education and skills, personality, offensive content, physical appearance, interests and age, gender, family status or other demographic traits. Thus screening based on social networking websites is very different from CV based screening, where we find that the dominant criterion is education and skills, with personality being a remote second.",2-s2.0-84962916656,0,2015,"Proceedings of the 2015 IEEE International Conference on Data Science and Advanced Analytics, DSAA 2015",1

Not much work has yet been undertaken in extracting these lexical cues from biographical data populating social media. Most of this work involves a large crowd of researchers leveraging dictionary-based approaches such as LIWC (which primarily focus on function words). By means of this paper we intend to introduce a novel method of personality mining from social media data called ""Adjectival-marker Technique"". This method involves extracting lexical features from descriptive texts (e.g. biographical data) to train a learning model, so as to predict the respective personality traits of the subject. Conceptually, it draws heavily from the last 78 years of work in lexical psychology and the Big Five personality test. However, it is not only a computational variant of the primordial theories of lexical psychology, but is also competent in conferring a substantial accuracy of personality prediction, matching that obtained by psychometric tests. In this study, we propose a variant of the Lexical Hypothesis from psychology. This modified hypothesis is validated by the computational results of personality prediction achieved by the Adjectival Marker Technique discussed below. The paper also discusses some insights illustrating the coherence of people's judgments about the subject's personality (virtual personality).

Human activity-travel behaviour (ATB) is a complex pattern of paths and activities in space and time. Studies indicate that ATB is the construction of daily habitual, weekly, monthly and seasonal routines together with strong variety seeking behaviour. Daily habitual travel patterns are usually taken as a basis, but for transportation planners more knowledge is needed on longitudinal trends in human ATB. Empirical data on prolonged perspective are hard to come by while mobile phone based call detail records could be one means of narrowing this research gap. By implementing this method, the present study attempts to provide new insights on individual monthly spatial travel behaviour. Using call detail records obtained from a set of anonymous mobile phone users, we examined their activity locations and activity spaces for 12 consecutive months. We found modest monthly variation in the number of activity locations, whereas there were great variations in the sizes of individual activity spaces. The monthly variation in individual spatial behaviour is explained up to 17% by seasonality, although the variance is predominantly attributed to individual factors and results indicate significant intrapersonal monthly variability. Findings suggest new avenues for future work on ATB from a longitudinal perspective.",2-s2.0-84889565652,1,2014,Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies,1

This paper proposes a research model that examines the effect of text content and social context on the performance of online reviews. To validate the model, a Tobit regression analysis was conducted in the Amazon.cn online shopping context. Hypotheses were tested on a data set of 2384 reviews over six different product categories. The results suggest that review sentiment, review quality, review perspective and the source credibility have positive impacts on perceived helpfulness, further influencing the online reviews performance. Moreover, the results confirm that product type is an influential variable to mediate the impacts. The findings also indicate that ratings does not play a behoved role in deciding whether the review is helpful as traditionally expected, nor does the date when reivews are published. This work applies sentiment mining method to understand the review content. The findings contribute to relevant literature by providing a deeper understanding of quantitative and qualitative predictors of online review performance.

The unique 'small-world' phenomenon of social networks shows that a typical pair of nodes is connected by very short chains of intermediate friends, and individuals are able to collectively discover such short paths. In this paper, we propose a decentralized algorithm that exploits this 'small-world' phenomenon to discover efficient routes to reach target nodes in unstructured social overlays. In order to test the performance of this algorithm, we simulate it on a real-world social graph dataset crawled from a large online social networking website (LiveJournal). Compared with other related works, the simulation results show that our proposed decentralized social routing algorithm not only shortens the median length of the search path, but also increases the success rate of finding such routes between arbitrary pair of nodes in the LiveJournal social graph.",2-s2.0-84875976043,1,2013,"2013 IEEE 10th Consumer Communications and Networking Conference, CCNC 2013",1

Many studies have shown that social data such as tweets are a rich source of information about the real-world including, for example, insights into health trends. A key limitation when analyzing Twitter data, however, is that it depends on people self-reporting their own behaviors and observations. In this paper, we present a large-scale quantitative analysis of some of the factors that influence self-reporting bias. In our study, we compare a year of tweets about weather events to ground-truth knowledge about actual weather occurrences. For each weather event we calculate how extreme, how expected, and how big a change the event represents. We calculate the extent to which these factors can explain the daily variations in tweet rates about weather events. We find that we can buildglobal models that take into account basic weather information, together with extremeness, expectation and change calculations to account for over 40% of the variability in tweet rates. We build location-specific (i.e., amodel per each metropolitan area) models that account for an average of 70% of the variability in tweet rates.

The web can be regarded as an ecosystem of digital resources connected and shaped by collective successive behaviors of users. Knowing how people allocate limited attention on different resources is of great importance. To answer this, we embed the most popular Chinese web sites into a high dimensional Euclidean space based on the open flow network model of a large number of Chinese users' collective attention flows, which both considers the connection topology of hyperlinks between the sites and the collective behaviors of the users. With these tools, we rank the web sites and compare their centralities based on flow distances with other metrics. We also study the patterns of attention flow allocation, and find that a large number of web sites concentrate on the central area of the embedding space, and only a small fraction of web sites disperse in the periphery. The entire embedding space can be separated into 3 regions(core, interim, and periphery). The sites in the core (1%) occupy a majority of the attention flows (40%), and the sites (34%) in the interim attract 40%, whereas other sites (65%) only take 20% flows. What's more, we clustered the web sites into 4 groups according to their positions in the space, and found that similar web sites in contents and topics are grouped together. In short, by incorporating the open flow network model, we can clearly see how collective attention allocates and flows on different web sites, and how web sites connected each other.",2-s2.0-84994342376,1,2016,PLoS ONE,1

Existing works in the literature that operate based on a known interest space cannot be directly applied to solve this problem. Such methods require at least a minimum user interaction with the topic to perform prediction. To tackle this problem, we integrate the semantic information derived from the Wikipedia category structure and the temporal evolution of user’s interests into our prediction model. More specifically, to capture the temporal behaviour of the topics and user’s interests, we consider discrete intervals and build user’s topic profile in each time interval separately. Then, we generalize users’ interests that have been observed over several time intervals by transferring them over the Wikipedia category structure. Our approach not only allows us to generalize users’ interests but also enables us to transfer users’ interests across different time intervals that do not necessarily have the same set of topics.

The ever increasing adoption of mobile technologies and ubiquitous services allows to sense human behavior at unprecedented level of details and scale. Wearable sensors, in particular, open up a new window on human mobility and proximity in a variety of indoor environments. Here we review stylized facts on the structural and dynamical properties of empirical networks of human face-to-face proximity, measured in three different real-world contexts: an academic conference, a hospital ward, and a museum exhibition. First, we discuss the structure of the aggregated contact networks, that project out the detailed ordering of contact events while preserving temporal heterogeneities in their weights. We show that the structural properties of aggregated networks highlight important differences and unexpected similarities across contexts, and discuss the additional complexity that arises from attributes that are typically associated with nodes in real-world interaction networks, such as role classes in hospitals. We then consider the empirical data at the finest level of detail, i.e., we consider time-dependent networks of face-to-face proximity between individuals. To gain insights on the effects that causal constraints have on spreading processes, we simulate the dynamics of a simple susceptible-infected model over the empirical time-resolved contact data. We show that the spreading pathways for the epidemic process are strongly affected by the temporal structure of the network data, and that the mere knowledge of static aggregated networks leads to erroneous conclusions about the transmission paths on the corresponding dynamical networks.",2-s2.0-84884137799,1,2013,European Physical Journal: Special Topics,1

Because social networks can improve engagement, which is a key mechanism of action, understanding the structure and potential impact of social networks could be key to improving mHealth effects. This study (a) evaluates social network characteristics of four distinct communication channels (discussion board, chat, e-mail, and blog) in a large social networking intervention, (b) predicts membership in online communities, and (c) evaluates whether community membership impacts engagement. Participants were 299 cancer survivors with significant distress using the 12-week health-space.net intervention. Social networking attributes (e.g., density and clustering) were identified separately for each type of network communication (i.e., discussion board, blog, web mail, and chat). Each channel demonstrated high levels of clustering, and being a community member in one communication channel was associated with being in the same community in each of the other channels (φ = 0.56-0.89, ps < 0.05). Predictors of community membership differed across communication channels, suggesting that each channel reached distinct types of users.

A key challenge in recommender systems is how to profile new users. A well-known solution for this problem is to ask new users to rate a few items to reveal their preferences and to use active learning to find optimally informative items. Compared to the application of active learning in classification (regression), active learning in recommender systems presents several differences: although there are no ratings for new users, there is an abundance of available ratings—collectively—from past (existing) users. In this paper, we propose an innovative approach for active learning in recommender systems, which aims at taking advantage of this additional information. The main idea is to consider existing users as (hypothetical) new users and solve an active learning problem for each of them. In the end, we aggregate all solved problems in order to learn how to solve the active learning problem for a real new user. As the ratings of existing users (i.e., labels) are known and are used for active learning purposes, the proposed framework is in fact a supervised active learning framework. Based on this framework, we investigate two different types of models: the first model is based on information about average item ratings and the second on matrix factorization.

Does Facebook change our willingness to disclose personal information? The present study proposes that the use of SNSs and the psychological disposition for self-disclosure interact reciprocally: Individuals with a stronger disposition show a higher tendency to use SNSs (selection effect). At the same time, frequent SNS use increases the wish to self-disclose online, because self-disclosing behaviors are reinforced through social capital within the SNS environment (socialization effect). In a longitudinal panel study, 488 users of SNSs were surveyed twice in a 6 months interval. Data were analyzed using structure equation modeling. The proposed reciprocal effects of SNS activities and self-disclosure were supported by the data: The disposition for online self-disclosure had a positive longitudinal effect on SNS use which in turn positively influenced the disposition for online self-disclosure. Both effects were moderated by the amount of social capital users received as a consequence of their SNS use.",2-s2.0-84868282969,1,2013,Computers in Human Behavior,1

The results of our analyses reveal numerous characteristics of Twitter search that differentiate it from more commonly studied search domains, such as web search. The findings also shed light on some of the difficulties users encounter.

Social media applications are extending the information and communication technology landscape in the public sector and are used to increase government transparency, participation and collaboration in the U.S. federal government. The success, impact and performance of these new forms of bi-directional and networked interactions can provide insights to understand compliance with the mandate of the Open Government Initiative. Many government agencies are experimenting with the use of social media, however very few actively measure the impact of their digital interactions. This article builds on insights from social media directors in the U.S. federal government highlighting their current lack of measurement practices for social media interactions. Based on their articulated needs for measurement, existing rules regulating the extent of measurement practices and technological features of the main social media platforms, a framework is presented that traces online interactions to mission support and the resulting social media tactics.

The current study investigated the equivalency of in-person and online administrations of the Right-Wing Authoritarianism, Social Dominance Orientation, and Modern Racism scales across three modalities (administration in person, online through Sona Systems, and online through Mechanical Turk). Results indicate that in-person administration was largely equivalent to the randomly assigned online sample (Sona Systems) in terms of their intercorrelations, mean scores, variability, and reliability. However, the Sona sample consistently responded with strong attitudes for all measures, suggesting that social desirability may be decreased when completing these measures online. In addition, the Mechanical Turk sample differed in many ways from both in-person and Sona administration; although this nonequivalence is at least partially explained by sample demographic differences, other considerations may have exacerbated nonequivalence, including prior exposure to the measures and a desire to respond correctly.",2-s2.0-84953390788,1,2017,Current Psychology,1

OBJECTIVES: The objectives for the current study are to demonstrate the methodology of implementation of a smartphone-based application for dissemination and collation of information during a crisis situation.BACKGROUND: Recent advancement in Internet based technologies have resulted in the growth of a sub-specialized field, termed as ""Infodemiology"" and ""Infoveillance"". Infoveillence refers to the collation of infodemiology measures for the purpose of surveillance and trending. Previous research has only demonstrated the research potential of Web 2.0 medium in collation of data in crisis situation.METHODS: The Haze Smartphone application was developed using an online application builder and using HTML5 as the core programming language. A five-phase developmental method including a) formulation of user requirements, b) system design, c) system development, d) system evaluation and finally e) system application and implementation were adopted. The smartphone application was deployed during a one-week period via a self-sponsored Facebook post and via direct dissemination of the web-links by emails.RESULTS: A total of 298 respondents took part in the survey within the application. Most of them were between the ages of 20- to 29-years old and had a university education. More individuals preferred the option of accessing and providing feedback to a survey on physical and psychological wellbeing via direct access to a Web-based questionnaire. In addition, the participants reported a mean number of 4.03 physical symptoms (SD 2.6). The total Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) score was 18.47 (SD 11.69), which indicated that the study population did experience psychological stress but not posttraumatic stress disorder. The perceived dangerous Pollutant Standards Index (PSI) level and the number of physical symptoms were associated with higher IES-R Score (P< 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates how a smartphone application could potentially be used to acquire research data in a crisis situation.

Secondly, we find that when we follow structurally stable Twitter communities over a period of months, their sentiment levels are also stable, and sudden changes in community sentiment from one day to the next can in most cases be traced to external events affecting the community.

710,7446,"Lin Z., Jin X., Xu X., Wang Y., Cheng X., Wang W., Meng D.",An unsupervised cross-lingual topic model framework for sentiment classification,"An unsupervised cross-lingual topic model framework for sentiment classification. Sentiment classification aims to determine the sentiment polarity expressed in a text. In online customer reviews, the sentiment polarities of words are usually dependent on the corresponding aspects. For instance, in mobile phone reviews, we may expect the long battery time but not enjoy the long response time of the operating system. Therefore, it is necessary and appealing to consider aspects when conducting sentiment classification. Probabilistic topic models that jointly detect aspects and sentiments have gained much success recently. However, most of the existing models are designed to work well in a language with rich resources. Directly applying those models on poor-quality corpora often leads to poor results. Consequently, a potential solution is to use the cross-lingual topic model to improve the sentiment classification for a target language by leveraging data and knowledge from a source language. However, the existing cross-lingual topic models are not suitable for sentiment classification because sentiment factors are not considered therein. To solve these problems, we propose for the first time a novel cross-lingual topic model framework which can be easily combined with the state-of-theart aspect/sentiment models. Extensive experiments in different domains and multiple languages demonstrate that our model can significantly improve the accuracy of sentiment classification in the target language.",2-s2.0-84962815428,1,2016,IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio Speech and Language Processing,1

Contrary to the notion that network positions are difficult to alter, I show that social media can induce a change in network structure, one from which individuals can derive economic benefits. In addition, I consider two intermediate mechanisms by which an information-rich network is theorized to improve work performance-information diversity and social communication-and quantify their effects on productivity and job security. Analysis shows that productivity, as measured by billable revenue, is more associated with information diversity than with social communication. However, the opposite is true for job security. Social communication is more correlated with reduced layoff risks than with information diversity. This, in turn, suggests that information-rich networks enabled through the use of social media can drive both work performance and job security, but that there is a trade-off between engaging in social communication and gathering diverse information.",2-s2.0-84877644300,1,2013,Information Systems Research,1

Modern science has become collaborative and digital. The Internet has supported the emergence of scientific digital platforms that globally connect programmers and users of novel digital scientific products such as scientific interactive software tools. These digital scientific innovations complement traditional text-based products like journal publications. This article is focused on the scientific impact of a platform’s programming community that produces these digital scientific innovations. The article’s main theoretical argument is that beyond an individual’s contribution efforts to these innovations, a new social structure affects his scientific recognition through citations of his tools in text-based publications. Taking a practice theory lens, we introduce the concept of a digital practice structure that emerges from the digital innovation work practice, performed by programmers who jointly work on a tool. This digital practice creates dependence forces among the community members in an analogy to Newton’s gravity concept. Our model represents such dependencies in a spatial autocorrelative model. We empirically estimate this model using data of the programming community of nanoHUB in which 477 nanotechnology tool programmers have contributed more than 715 million lines of code. Our results show that a programmer’s contributions to digital innovations may have positive effects, while the digital practice structure creates negative dependency effects. Colloquially speaking, being surrounded by star performers can be harmful. Our findings suggest that modeling scientific impact needs to account for a scientist’s contribution to programming communities that produce digital scientific innovations and the digital work structures in which these contributions are embedded.",2-s2.0-84986300658,1,2017,Scientometrics,1

News-media organisations are operating in increasingly competitive and fragmented markets for audiences and advertising revenues. Through the advent of the Internet, regional news media are experiencing a revolution in their production and administrative processes, such that their survival depends on their ability to find a workable online business model. A growing army of bloggers and amateur citizen journalists now delivers – but rarely edits – content for all media platforms, while new media technologies, combined with the changing structure of regional news industries, are radically changing the ways in which a news-media organisation functions and achieves profitability. Our research seeks to answer the question of how the Internet is impacting on producer/consumer value activities in the regional news media. To answer this question, 15 semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted at three regional newspapers, followed by a focus group with London-based newsmedia organisations (including radio and television) and bloggers, which aimed to expand our analysis from its initial focus on the impact of the Internet on print media (paid-for and free newspapers) to that of online cocreation activities. Our findings show that regional news media face fierce competition for audience and advertising from an ever-growing host of other media and advertising mediums, both new and traditional. There is a strategic gap in terms of media organisations’ use of the Internet (despite their developing multimedia portfolios) such that they are not fully harnessing the unique potential of social media to deliver engaging user experiences.

Drawing on the concept of affordances (Gibson, 1977, 1986; Norman, 1988; Hogan, 2009) and the work of Doreen Massey (1994, 2005, 2009), it can be shown that subjects act on perceived affordances in narratives of online and offline relations, which intersect to produce the spaces in which social interactions are situated. This chapter proposes the concept of ""networked spaces"" as a strategy for resolving the problematic binary of online and offline. Networked spaces are dynamic, and the contexts or narratives within them, relational. It is through the lived experiences of interactions in these spaces that the contexts of social interactions are suggested to be best examined.",2-s2.0-84898187838,1,2011,Networked Sociability and Individualism: Technology for Personal and Professional Relationships,1

Identifying influential peers is an important issue for business to promote commercial strategies in social networks. This paper proposes a conductance eigenvector centrality (CEC) model to measure peer influence in the complex social network. The CEC model considers the social network as a conductance network and constructs methods to calculate the conductance matrix of the network. By a novel random walk mechanism, the CEC model obtains stable CEC values which measure the peer influence in the network. The experiments show that the CEC model can achieve robust performance in identifying peer influence. It outperforms the benchmark algorithms and obtains excellent outcomes when the network has high clustering coefficient.",2-s2.0-84991254261,0,2016,Neurocomputing,1

Although the theory of agenda-setting is a pillar of political communication research, understanding the dynamics of public attention remains an important challenge as the communication system becomes increasingly fragmented. The development of ideologically oriented niche media and the ability of the mainstream media to carefully track the interests of their audience suggest that both public interest and niche media attention to an issue could affect the mainstream media’s agenda itself. We develop and test the theory of agenda-uptake to isolate when mainstream media influences both public and niche media attention to issues and when public interest and niche media attention influence the mainstream media to cover an issue. Analyzing mainstream and niche media coverage along with Google Trends individual search data for 4 issues in 2008, we provide evidence that the dynamics of agenda-uptake are crucial to understanding the character and content of the information environment in the 21st century.

Social networking sites have been increasingly gaining popularity. Well-known sites such as Facebook have been reporting growth rates as high as 3% per week [5]. Many social networking sites have millions of registered users who use these sites to share photographs, contact long-lost friends, establish new business contacts and to keep in touch. In this paper, we investigate how easy it would be for a potential attacker to launch automated crawling and identity theft attacks against a number of popular social networking sites in order to gain access to a large volume of personal user information. The first attack we present is the automated identity theft of existing user profiles and sending of friend requests to the contacts of the cloned victim. The hope, from the attacker's point of view, is that the contacted users simply trust and accept the friend request. By establishing a friendship relationship with the contacts of a victim, the attacker is able to access the sensitive personal information provided by them. In the second, more advanced attack we present, we show that it is effective and feasible to launch an automated, cross-site profile cloning attack. In this attack, we are able to automatically create a forged profile in a network where the victim is not registered yet and contact the victim's friends who are registered on both networks. Our experimental results with real users show that the automated attacks we present are effective and feasible in practice.

While the weblog medium has grown out of a few modest technological innovations, the social and behavioral aspects of this emerging practice represent a large shift towards a new form of interaction: a massively distributed but completely connected conversation covering every imaginable topic of interest. This paper seeks to understand the social implications of hypertext links within the community, both from a systemic view of the entire network, and also from the perspective of individual authors. Using a large corpus of weblogs collected over a one-month period, an analysis of the structural properties of the weblog readership network is presented. These findings are compared to the results of an online survey of weblog authors around the topics of weblog use and linking behavior. Both cases suggest that the largest contributing factor to weblog audience size is the amount that an author invests into the practice.

In this paper, we propose a concise and analyzable model to study the effects of mass media modeled as an applied external field, and social networks on public opinions based on the multi-state voter model, and a tuned parameter can control the relative intensity of the effects of mass media and social networks. We consider a generalized scenario where there exist committed or stubborn agents in the networks whose opinions are not affected by their friends or mass media. We find that the fraction of each opinion will converge to a value which only relates to the fractions and degrees of stubborn agents, and the relative intensity between media and network effects. The final agents with media opinion, except the stubborn agents, also include the increment produced by the internal impact of social networks and that caused by the external impact of media. Interestingly the second increment is composed of two parts, one is from the media effect when there are no interactions between agents and the other is from the influence of media on agent opinions caused by social network structure. That is the interactions among agents within social networks can amplify media influence.

Due to the increasing popularity of various applications for smartphones, 3G networks are currently overloaded by mobile data traffic. Offloading cellular traffic through opportunistic communications is a promising solution to partially solve this problem, because there is no monetary cost for it. As a case study, we investigate the target-set selection problem for information delivery in the emerging Mobile Social Networks (MoSoNets). We propose to exploit opportunistic communications to facilitate the information dissemination and thus reduce the amount of cellular traffic. In particular, we study how to select the target set with only k users, such that we can minimize the cellular data traffic. In this scenario, initially the content service providers deliver information over cellular networks to only users in the target set. Then through opportunistic communications, target-users will further propagate the information among all the subscribed users. Finally, service providers will send the information to users who fail to receive it before the delivery deadline (i.e., delay-tolerance threshold). We propose three algorithms, called Greedy, Heuristic, and Random, for this problem and evaluate their performance through an extensive trace-driven simulation study. The simulation results verify the efficiency of these algorithms for both synthetic and real-world mobility traces. For example, the Heuristic algorithm can offload cellular traffic by up to 73.66% for a real-world mobility trace.",2-s2.0-78649313781,1,2010,"Proceedings of the Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking, MOBICOM",1

Often this aggregation occurs across traditional spatial or community boundaries that serve as cues for self-presentation and impression formation. This paper explores these issues through an interview study of Grindr users. Grindr is a location-aware real-time dating application for men who have sex with men.

A fundamental aspect of all social networks is information sharing. It is one of the most common forms of online interaction that is tightly associated with social media preservation and information disclosure. As such, information sharing is commonly viewed as a key enabler for social media preservation tasks. In the current situation, where information sharing and inter-user communications are made instantly possible via the widespread use of ubiquitous technologies, privacy related, and particularly information disclosure issues, are the obvious, much discussed, immediate consequences of information sharing. As a result, information disclosure, especially when multimedia data come to play, is critical for appropriate social media preservation strategies that consider and respect the privacy of social network users. Social media preservation must align with privacy protection solutions and consequently must protect sensitive information that social network users would like to keep private. In this paper, we propose a new approach to implement a privacy-oriented social media preservation strategy that prevents the disclosure of sensitive information. Instead of using a preserve-all strategy, we present a framework to personalize social media preservation tasks. We then describe our proposed rule-based algorithm to evaluate information disclosure addressing mainly relationship type disclosure and using shared photos.

Many real social networks evolve the connections in multiple layers (e.g. multiple social networking platforms). In this article, we study the link prediction problem in multiplex networks. As an example, we consider a multiplex network of Twitter (as a microblogging service) and Foursquare (as a location-based social network). We consider social networks of the same users in these two platforms and develop a meta-path-based algorithm for predicting the links. The connectivity information of the two layers is used to predict the links in Foursquare network. Three classical classifiers (naive Bayes, support vector machines (SVM) and K-nearest neighbour) are used for the classification task. Although the networks are not highly correlated in the layers, our experiments show that including the cross-layer information significantly improves the prediction performance.

Although the community structure can reduce the number of infected people for same infection rate, it will not significantly affect nodes' susceptibility. We find the susceptibility of individuals is sensitive to the choice of spreading dynamics. For SIR spreading, since the susceptibility is highly correlated to nodes' influence, the topological indicator k-shell can better identify highly susceptible individuals, outperforming degree, betweenness centrality and PageRank. In contrast, in rumor spreading model, where nodes' susceptibility and influence have no clear correlation, degree performs the best among considered topological measures.

The research presented here aims to improve risk communication of hazardous weather information on the PnC web page. The focus is on improving communication of threat existence and threat timing because this important information influences how individuals perceive and respond to a weather risk. Experimental presentations of PnC forecast information were designed for two weather scenarios: a severe thunderstorm warning and a flood watch. The experimental presentations were created by adding new textual and graphical pieces of information that were intended to better convey threat existence and timing, and they were evaluated through two rounds of nationwide surveys of PnC web page users. The survey results show that the default presentation of forecast information on the PnC web page was the least effective at conveying hazardous weather threat existence and timing. Adding start-time text and end-time text, when these information pieces were coupled, helped respondents understand the precise time that weather threats were in effect for the rapid-onset, short-duration severe thunderstorm warning and for the delayed-start, longer-duration flood watch. Adding a box graphic placed around the forecast icons further enhanced communication effectiveness by drawing respondents' attention to the weather threat.

Using data from a random sample totaling 113,985 tweets and 30,995 users, we examine the differences between users who employ various strategies to talk about US 2010 Congressional candidates. We show that users who simply include the text of a candidate's name in a message exhibit different behaviors than those who use platform-specific mechanisms. Users who employ free-text tend to have younger accounts, are less likely to be 'verified', and generate fewer messages about candidates. Furthermore, candidates' share of the free-text Twitter public has a larger correlation with their vote tallies than @mentions or hashtags. This research has methodological implications for studying the dynamics between online discourse and offline behavior. Overall, our findings support the view that forms of communication that are more accessible are more indicative of broader social trends.",2-s2.0-84979172052,1,2016,Current Research on Information Technologies and Society: Papers from the 2013 Meetings of the American Sociological Association,1

The benefits of tourism have been drawing a great deal of attention from tourists, community, and society alike. This study investigates how tourists' story sharing activities influence their post-purchase behavioral process, depending on different communication conditions. Two 2x2 between-subject experiments were conducted with recent travelers in the U.S. Results reveal tourists' post-purchase behavioral processes depend on what, how, and with whom they engage in post-trip story sharing activity. Findings contribute to the literature on purchase-driven happiness, self-enhancement, well-being, and communications by providing evidence on how different communication conditions alter the effects of tourists' story sharing on their post-purchase behavioral outcomes. Findings also suggest that destination marketers should apply strategies to encourage tourists’ story sharing activity.",2-s2.0-85018752862,1,2017,Tourism Management,1

Complex networks appear in almost every aspect of science and technology. Previous work in network theory has focused primarily on analyzing single networks that do not interact with other networks, despite the fact that many real-world networks interact with and depend on each other. Very recently an analytical framework for studying the percolation properties of interacting networks has been introduced. Here we review the analytical framework and the results for percolation laws for a network of networks (NON) formed by interdependent random networks. The percolation properties of a network of networks differ greatly from those of single isolated networks. In particular, although networks with broad degree distributions, e.g., scale-free networks, are robust when analyzed as single networks, they become vulnerable in a NON. Moreover, because the constituent networks of a NON are connected by node dependencies, a NON is subject to cascading failure. When there is strong interdependent coupling between networks, the percolation transition is discontinuous (is a first-order transition), unlike the well-known continuous second-order transition in single isolated networks. We also review some possible real-world applications of NON theory.",2-s2.0-84897724545,1,2014,Understanding Complex Systems,1

As to the relationship between extraverted disposition and preference for social communication on Internet community, there have been two hypotheses: ""Social Enhancement"" (""Rich Get Richer"") and ""Social Compensation"" (""Poor Get Richer""). In this paper, we examined the role of using real-life portrait as facial picture in determining whether an extraverted user would be sociable on Internet community. 203 Chinese Social Networking Site (SNS) users were administrated with Big Five Inventory (BFI) to collect their scores on extraversion, and their web use behaviors were downloaded via Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). Results showed that, the factor of using real-life portrait as facial picture played a moderating role in the relationship between scores on extraversion and number of online friends (β = 0.33, p < 0.05). For people using real-life portrait as facial picture, increased scores on extraversion were associated with increased number of online friends (β = 0.33, p < 0.001); conversely, for people using none real-life portrait, there were no significant relationship between scores on extraversion and number of online friends (β = -0.04, p = 0.85).",2-s2.0-84904796574,1,2014,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),1

Mobile telephony (e.g., Global System for Mobile Communications [GSM]) is today's most common communication solution. Due to the specific characteristics of mobile communication infrastructure, it can provide real added value to the user and various other parties. Location information and mobility patterns of subscribers contribute not only to emergency planning, general safety, and security, but are also a driving force for new commercial services. However, there is a lack of transparency in today's mobile telephony networks regarding location disclosure. Location information is generated, collected, and processed without being noticed by subscribers. Hence, by exploiting subscriber location information, an individual's privacy is threatened. We develop a utility-based opponent model to formalize the conflict between the additional utility of mobile telephony infrastructure being able to locate subscribers and the individual's privacy. Based on these results, measures were developed to improve an individual's location privacy through a user-controllable GSM software stack. To analyze and evaluate the effects of specific subscriber provider interaction, a dedicated test environment will be presented, using the example of GSM mobile telephony networks. The resulting testbed is based on real-life hardware and open-source software to create a realistic and defined environment that includes all aspects of the air interface in mobile telephony networks and thus, is capable of controlling subscriber-provider interaction in a defined and fully controlled environment.",2-s2.0-84876795435,0,2013,IEEE Systems Journal,1

Based upon a set of 2,739 academic monographs from 2008 and a set of 1,305 best-selling books in 15 Amazon.com academic subject categories, the existence of significant but low or moderate correlations between citations and numbers of reviews, combined with other evidence, suggests that online book reviews tend to reflect the wider popularity of a book rather than its academic impact, although there are substantial disciplinary differences.

Mobile media have become increasingly popular and important in recent years as a means of accessing political information and participating in politics and elections worldwide. However, the emergent field of mobile-focused political participation research requires further definition and development to more clearly address why and how mobile media are producing distinct consequences for political participation. To address this problem, this article uses interdisciplinary insights and a critical review of relevant literature to identify research opportunities that stand to advance mobile political communication theory. Contributions and limitations of studies focused on ICTs and political participation are reviewed and discussed. Analysis of studies focused on the political participation outcomes of mobile media use is synthesized with theory from user-focused mobile communication literature to highlight the unique qualities that distinguish mobile media and the implications of those distinguishing features for studying political participation. Recommendations are made for research directions that would further investigate the association of mobile media’s distinctive features with online and offline forms of political participation. This analysis indicates opportunities for scholars to unpack mobile media’s unique features in ways that potentially redefine political participation, and, accordingly, further the development of research questions and theories that investigate the relationship of mobile media and political participation. It is concluded that research is needed that explains mobile media use in finer detail, accounts for shifting conceptualizations of political participation, and contributes to the development of cross-cultural comparative frameworks.",2-s2.0-85002938534,1,2014,Mobile Media and Communication,1

Recently, many efforts have been spent on observing individual's psychological states through analyzing users' social activities on SNS.

Then, for more accurately understand their tweets, we exploit all media types of tweets, i.e., images and emoticons as well as texts, thus develop a multimodal method for analyzing them. In the proposed method, three single-modal analyses are first performed for extract the hidden users' moods from text, emoticon, and images: a learning based text analysis, a word-based emoticon analysis, and a SVM based image classifier. Thereafter, the extracted moods from the respective analyses are integrated into a mood and again aggregated per a day, which allows for continuous monitoring of user's mood trends. To assess the validity of the proposed method, two types of experiments were performed: 1) the proposed multimodal analysis was tested with a number of tweets, and its performance was compared to SentiStrength; 2) it was applied to classify 45 users' mental states as depressive and non-depressive ones. Then, the results demonstrated that the proposed method outperforms the baseline, and it is effective in finding depressive moods for users.",2-s2.0-84964680303,0,2016,"2016 International Conference on Big Data and Smart Computing, BigComp 2016",1

Later on, the system determines the winner brand of each city according to the percentage of positive tweets sent by users located in the aforementioned cities. Lastly, the winner brands of the day can be monitored on a web page using Google Maps. To increase the performance of classification methods, the tweet texts are preprocessed, such as through converting all the letters to lower case, both for training hand-classified dataset and for the collected tweets.

A large portion of previous research on knowledge sharing in virtual community focuses on organization-sponsored professional virtual communities (PVC) while nowadays numerous nonwork- related virtual communities are gaining popularity. This study investigates the phenomenon of knowledge sharing in one popular type of non-work-related virtual community, online question and answering community. Anchoring on the self-determination theory, this study identifies three types of motivations to share knowledge in the community. Particularly, rewards in reputation system, which we further divide into rewards for quantity and for quality, are classified as extrinsic motivation; learning is classified as internalized extrinsic motivation and enjoy helping is classified as intrinsic motivation. Moreover, while previous studies tend to hold a monolithic view of knowledge contribution, this study regards quantity and quality as two important parts of knowledge contribution and argues there are different underlying mechanisms leading to them. Therefore we investigate the effects of the three motivations on quantity and quality separately. An online survey with 367 participants was conducted in a leading Chinese online question and answering community to test the research model. Results show that the motivational factors do have different effects on quality and quantity of knowledge contribution. While rewards in reputation systems for quantity can effectively enhance knowledge contribution quantity, rewards for quality do not lead to high quality knowledge contribution. Learning is revealed as a crucial motivational factor in this context as it is positively related with both aspects of knowledge contribution. Finally, enjoy helping is weakly related with knowledge contribution quality and strongly associated with knowledge contribution quantity. Both theoretical and practical implications are discussed.",2-s2.0-84855856994,1,2011,PACIS 2011 - 15th Pacific Asia Conference on Information Systems: Quality Research in Pacific,1

Background: Seasonal influenza outbreaks are a serious burden for public health worldwide and cause morbidity to millions of people each year. In the temperate zone influenza is predominantly seasonal, with epidemics occurring every winter, but the severity of the outbreaks vary substantially between years. In this study we used a highly detailed database, which gave us both temporal and spatial information of influenza dynamics in Israel in the years 1998-2009. We use a discrete-time stochastic epidemic SIR model to find estimates and credible confidence intervals of key epidemiological parameters. Findings: Despite the biological complexity of the disease we found that a simple SIR-type model can be fitted successfully to the seasonal influenza data. This was true at both the national levels and at the scale of single cities.The effective reproductive number Re varies between the different years both nationally and among Israeli cities. However, we did not find differences in Re between different Israeli cities within a year. Re was positively correlated to the strength of the spatial synchronization in Israel. For those years in which the disease was more ""infectious"", then outbreaks in different cities tended to occur with smaller time lags. Our spatial analysis demonstrates that both the timing and the strength of the outbreak within a year are highly synchronized between the Israeli cities. We extend the spatial analysis to demonstrate the existence of high synchrony between Israeli and French influenza outbreaks. Conclusions: The data analysis combined with mathematical modeling provided a better understanding of the spatio-temporal and synchronization dynamics of influenza in Israel and between Israel and France. Altogether, we show that despite major differences in demography and weather conditions intra-annual influenza epidemics are tightly synchronized in both their timing and magnitude, while they may vary greatly between years. The predominance of a similar main strain of influenza, combined with population mixing serve to enhance local and global influenza synchronization within an influenza season.",2-s2.0-84867317904,0,2012,PLoS ONE,1

Introduction: The ability to predict the growth and decline of infectious disease incidence has advanced considerably in recent years. In particular, accurate forecasts of influenza epidemiology have been developed using a number of approaches. Methods: Within our own group we produce weekly operational real-time forecasts of influenza at the municipal and state level in the U.S. These forecasts are generated using ensemble simulations depicting local influenza transmission dynamics, which have been optimized prior to forecast with observations of influenza incidence and data assimilation methods. The expected accuracy of a given forecast can be inferred in real-time through quantification of the agreement (e.g. the variance) among the ensemble of simulations. Results: Here we show that forecast expected accuracy can be further discriminated with the additional consideration of the streak or persistence of the forecast—the number of consecutive weeks the forecast has converged to the same outcome. Discussion: The findings indicate that the use of both the streak and ensemble agreement provides a more detailed and informative assessment of forecast expected accuracy.",2-s2.0-84958580699,1,2015,PLoS Currents,1

Twitter is one of the most popular microblogging social systems, which provides a set of distinctive posting services operating in real time. The flexibility of these services has attracted unethical individuals, so-called ""spammers"", aiming at spreading malicious, phishing, and misleading information. Unfortunately, the existence of spam results non-ignorable problems related to search and user's privacy. In the battle of fighting spam, various detection methods have been designed, which work by automating the detection process using the ""features"" concept combined with machine learning methods. However, the existing features are not effective enough to adapt spammers' tactics due to the ease of manipulation in the features. Also, the graph features are not suitable for Twitter based applications, though the high performance obtainable when applying such features. In this paper, beyond the simple statistical features such as number of hashtags and number of URLs, we examine the time property through advancing the design of some features used in the literature, and proposing new time based features. The new design of features is divided between robust advanced statistical features incorporating explicitly the time attribute, and behavioral features identifying any posting behavior pattern. The experimental results show that the new form of features is able to classify correctly the majority of spammers with an accuracy higher than 93% when using Random Forest learning algorithm, applied on a collected and annotated data-set. The results obtained outperform the accuracy of the state of the art features by about 6%, proving the significance of leveraging time in detecting spam accounts.",2-s2.0-85009787108,0,2016,"8th International Conference on Management of Digital EcoSystems, MEDES 2016",1

A large number of articles and projects associated with the topic appeared over the last few years, and with them the need for properly classifying and organizing these works. In this paper, we propose a taxonomy of citizen sensing initiatives and illustrate each of its dimensions through a survey of recent articles in the area. The proposed scheme also supports the identification and stimulates the development of projects addressing data collection methodologies that have not been properly explored so far. In addition, we present a platform capable of aggregating, analyzing, and extracting knowledge from data generated by physical and human sensing techniques.

Communication with other twitter users is carried out by publishing text and media based posts called tweets. Lately, Twitter has attracted a large number of automated programs, known as bots. Generally bots are used to generate a large amount of benign tweets delivering news and updating feeds, whereas some bots are being created to spread spam or malicious contents. To assist human users in identifying who they are communicating with, this project focuses on the classification of human and bot accounts on Twitter. We collected twitter statistics of a number of twitter users, their tweets, bot tweets, features, characteristics, etc. The data is then analyzed based on statistics to create a known training set of bots and humans. The proposed classification system uses a number of twitter attributes where every stage of the system makes a decision about the users of Twitter. Based on the statistical training data a decision tree is generated. Rules are formed using the decision tree to detect the user of twitter as a human or a bot. The various properties based on twitter features help distinguishing a human from a bot are discussed and implemented in this paper. Based on the results obtained it can be concluded that the more number of attributes, better is the detection mechanism.

Understanding the collective reaction to individual actions is key to effectively spread information in social media. In this work we define efficiency on Twitter, as the ratio between the emergent spreading process and the activity employed by the user. We characterize this property by means of a quantitative analysis of the structural and dynamical patterns emergent from human interactions, and show it to be universal across several Twitter conversations. We found that some influential users efficiently cause remarkable collective reactions by each message sent, while the majority of users must employ extremely larger efforts to reach similar effects. Next we propose a model that reproduces the retweet cascades occurring on Twitter to explain the emergent distribution of the user efficiency. The model shows that the dynamical patterns of the conversations are strongly conditioned by the topology of the underlying network.

Despite the popular use of social media by consumers and marketers, empirical research investigating their economic values still lags. In this study, we integrate qualitative user-marketer interaction content data from a fan page brand community on Facebook and consumer transactions data to assemble a unique data set at the individual consumer level. We then quantify the impact of community contents from consumers (user-generated content, i.e., UGC) and marketers (marketer-generated content, i.e., MGC) on consumers' apparel purchase expenditures. A content analysis method was used to construct measures to capture the informative and persuasive nature of UGC and MGC while distinguishing between directed and undirected communication modes in the brand community. In our empirical analysis, we exploit differences across consumers' fan page joining decision and across timing differences in fan page joining dates for our model estimation and identification strategies. Importantly, we also control for potential self-selection biases and relevant factors such as pricing, promotion, social network attributes, consumer demographics, and unobserved heterogeneity. Our findings show that engagement in social media brand communities leads to a positive increase in purchase expenditures. Additional examinations of UGC and MGC impacts show evidence of social media contents affecting consumer purchase behavior through embedded information and persuasion. We also uncover the different roles played by UGC and MGC, which vary by the type of directed or undirected communication modes by consumers and the marketer. Specifically, the elasticities of demand with respect to UGC information richness are 0.006 (directed communication) and 3.140 (undirected communication), whereas those for MGC information richness are insignificant. Moreover, the UGC valence elasticity of demand is 0.180 (undirected communication), whereas that for MGC valence is 0.004 (directed communication). Overall, UGC exhibits a stronger impact than MGC on consumer purchase behavior.

Lateral gene transfer (LGT) plays a major role in prokaryote evolution with only a few genes that are resistant to it; yet the nature and magnitude of barriers to lateral transfer are still debated. Here, we implement directed networks to investigate donor-recipient events of recent lateral gene transfer among 657 sequenced prokaryote genomes. For 2,129,548 genes investigated, we detected 446,854 recent lateral gene transfer events through nucleotide pattern analysis. Among these, donor-recipient relationships could be specified through phylogenetic reconstruction for 7% of the pairs, yielding 32,028 polarized recent gene acquisition events, which constitute the edges of our directed networks. We find that the frequency of recent LGT is linearly correlated both with genome sequence similarity and with proteome similarity of donor-recipient pairs. Genome sequence similarity accounts for 25% of the variation in gene-transfer frequency, with proteome similarity adding only 1% to the variability explained. The range of donor-recipient GC content similarity within the network is extremely narrow, with 86% of the LGTs occurring between donor-recipient pairs having ≤5% difference in GC content. Hence, genome sequence similarity and GC content similarity are strong barriers to LGT in prokaryotes. But they are not insurmountable, as we detected 1530 recent transfers between distantly related genomes. The directed network revealed that recipient genomes of distant transfers encode proteins of nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ; a DNA repair mechanism) far more frequently than the recipient lacking that mechanism. This implicates NHEJ in genes spread across distantly related prokaryotes through bypassing the donor-recipient sequence similarity barrier.",2-s2.0-79953315166,1,2011,Genome Research,1

However, identifying such social influence is tricky because these activities are simultaneously impacted by influence and homophily. We propose a statistical procedure that uses commonly available network and observational data about people's actions to estimate the extent of copy-influence-mimicking others' actions that appear in a feed. We assume that non-friends don't influence users; thus, comparing how a user's activity correlates with friends versus non-friends who have similar preferences can help tease out the effect of copy-influence. Experiments on datasets from multiple social networks show that estimates that don't account for homophily overestimate copy-influence by varying, often large amounts. Further, copy-influence estimates fall below 1% of total actions in all networks: most people, and almost all actions, are not affected by the feed.

Background: The onset of type 2 diabetes mellitus can be prevented or delayed by lifestyle changes. Communication technologies such as a mobile phone can be used as a means of delivering these lifestyle changes. Objectives: The purposes of this analysis were to explore applicability of potential components of a mobile phone-based healthy lifestyle program and to understand motivators and barriers to continued engagement in a mobile phone healthy lifestyle program. Methods: We conducted 6 focus groups (4 female and 2 male groups) in May and June 2010 with 35 focus group participants. The qualitative data were analyzed by 3 researchers using a qualitative description method in an ATLAS.ti software program. Inclusion criteria for enrollment in a focus group were as follows: (1) being aged from 30 to 69 years, (2) speaking and reading English, (3) having a sedentary lifestyle at work or during leisure time (screened by the Brief Physical Activity Survey questionnaire), and (4) having a body mass index (BMI) &gt;25 kg/m2 (Asian &gt;23 kg/m2) based on self-reported weight and height or 5) having a self-reported prediabetic condition.

Recently, aspect based opinion mining has been introduced which targets the various aspects present in the opinion text. A number of existing aspect based opinion classification methods are available in the literature but very limited research work has targeted the automatic aspect identification and extraction of implicit, infrequent, and coreferential aspects. Aspect based classification suffers from the presence of irrelevant sentences in a typical user review. Such sentences make the data noisy and degrade the classification accuracy of the machine learning algorithms.

We propose a novel rating prediction scheme, FluidRating, which uses fluid dynamics theory to reveal the time-evolving formulation process of human opinions. The recommendation is modeled as fluid with two dimensions: the temperature is taken as the 'opinion/rating,' and its volume is deemed as the 'persistency,' representing how much one insists on his opinion. When new opinions come, each user refines his opinion through a round of fluid exchange with his neighbors.

With the popularity of positioning devices, Web 2.0 technology, and trip sharing services, many users are willing to log and share their trips on the Web. Thus, trip planning Web sites are able to provide some new services by inferring Regions-Of-Interest (ROIs) and recommending popular travel routes from trip trajectories. We argue that simply providing some travel routes consisting of popular ROIs to users is not sufficient. To tour around a wide geographical area, for example, a city, some users may prefer a trip to visit as many ROIs as possible, while others may like to stop by only a few ROIs for an in-depth visit. We refer to a trip fitting the former user group as an in-breadth trip and a trip suitable for the latter user group as an in-depth trip. Prior studies on trip planning have focused on mining ROIs and travel routes without considering these different preferences. In this article, given a spatial range and a user preference of depth/breadth specified by a user, we develop a Pattern-Aware Trajectory Search (PATS) framework to retrieve the top K trajectories passing through popular ROIs. PATS is novel because the returned travel trajectories, discovered from travel patterns hidden in trip trajectories, may represent the most valuable travel experiences of other travelers fitting the user's trip preference in terms of depth or breadth. The PATS framework comprises two components: travel behavior exploration and trajectory search. The travel behavior exploration component determines a set of ROIs along with their attractive scores by considering not only the popularity of the ROIs but also the travel sequential relationships among the ROIs. To capture the travel sequential relationships among ROIs and to derive their attractive scores, a user movement graph is constructed. For the trajectory search component of PATS, we formulate two trajectory score functions, the depth-trip score function and the breadth-trip score function, by taking into account the number of ROIs in a trajectory and their attractive scores. Accordingly, we propose an algorithm, namely, Bounded Trajectory Search (BTS), to efficiently retrieve the top K trajectories based on the two trajectory scores. The PATS framework is evaluated by experiments and user studies using a real dataset. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and the efficiency of the proposed PATS framework.",2-s2.0-84880194316,1,2013,ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology,1

In this work, a benchmark to evaluate the retrieval performance of soundtrack recommendation systems is proposed. Such systems aim at finding songs that are played as background music for a given set of images. The proposed benchmark is based on preference judgments, where relevance is considered a continuous ordinal variable and judgments are collected for pairs of songs with respect to a query (i.e., set of images). To capture a wide variety of songs and images, we use a large space of possible music genres, different emotions expressed through music, and various query-image themes. The benchmark consists of two types of relevance assessments: (i) judgments obtained from a user study, that serve as a ""gold standard"" for (ii) relevance judgments gathered through Amazon's Mechanical Turk. We report on the performance of two state-of-the-art soundtrack recommendation systems using the proposed benchmark.

With the rapid increasing of smart mobile devices and the advances of sensing technologies, mobile crowd sensing (MCS) becomes a new popular sensing paradigm, which enables a variety of large-scale sensing applications. One of the key challenges of large-scale mobile crowd sensing systems is how to effectively select appropriate participants from a huge user pool to perform various sensing tasks while satisfying certain constraints. This becomes more complex when the sensing tasks are dynamic (coming in real time) and heterogeneous (having different temporal and spacial requirements). In this paper, we consider such a dynamic participant recruitment problem with heterogeneous sensing tasks which aims to minimize the sensing cost while maintaining certain level of probabilistic coverage. Both offline and online algorithms are proposed to solve the challenging problem.

Modern online social network platforms are replacing traditional media due to their effectiveness in both spreading information and communicating opinions. One of the key problems in these online platforms is to predict the global spread range of any given information. Due to its gigantic size as well as time-varying dynamics, an online social network's global structure, however, is usually inaccessible to most researchers. Thus, it raises the very important issue of how to use solely small subnetworks to predict the global influence. In this paper, based on percolation theory, we show that the global spread range can be predicted well from only two small subnetworks.

Conficker is a computer worm that erupted on the Internet in 2008. It is unique in combining three different spreading strategies: local probing, neighbourhood probing, and global probing. We propose a mathematical model that combines three modes of spreading: local, neighbourhood, and global, to capture the worm's spreading behaviour. The parameters of the model are inferred directly from network data obtained during the first day of the Conficker epidemic. The model is then used to explore the tradeoff between spreading modes in determining the worm's effectiveness. Our results show that the Conficker epidemic is an example of a critically hybrid epidemic, in which the different modes of spreading in isolation do not lead to successful epidemics. Such hybrid spreading strategies may be used beneficially to provide the most effective strategies for promulgating information across a large population.

The phenomenon is modeled in the context of activity-driven networks, in which contacts occur on the basis of activity potentials. To offer insight into behavioral strategies targeting both susceptible and infected individuals, we consider two separate behaviors that may emerge in respiratory syndromes and sexually transmitted infections. The first is related to a reduction in the activity of infected individuals due to quarantine or illness. The second is instead associated with a selfish self-protective behavior of susceptible individuals, who tend to reduce contact with the rest of the population on the basis of a risk perception.

Most solutions to this problem are typically based on increases or spikes in frequency of terms in social media. In our case, we explore whether sudden changes in the positivity or negativity that keywords are typically associated with can be exploited for this purpose. A data set that contains several million Twitter messages over a 1-month time span is presented and experimental results demonstrate that sentiment analysis can be successfully utilized for this purpose. Further experiments study the sensitivity of both frequency- or sentiment-based solutions to a number of parameters. Concretely, we show that the number of tweets that are used for event detection is an important factor, while the number of days used to extract token frequency or sentiment averages is not. Lastly, we present results focusing on detecting local events and conclude that all approaches are dependant on the level of coverage that such events receive in social media.",2-s2.0-84973922790,1,2016,Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology,1

In this paper, we study the disclosure of private information concealed on a social network under an information extraction attack. The novelty of this attack is that it combines web search with information extraction and data mining techniques to discover private information that is hidden on a social network by considering web pages outside of the given social network. We also define a quantitative measure of the risk of privacy disclosure under this and other similar attacks, given the privacy policy and protection mechanism of a social network website. We show that with some public information of a victim from a social network, it is not too difficult for the adversary to utilize this attack to find other private information of the victim hidden on the social network.

In the current study we investigated if Facebook user behavior might help start to explain interactions between Facebook use, stress and health. In this prospective study, healthy college students completed online questionnaires assessing Facebook use, health and then were followed for 10 weeks to track incidence of upper respiratory infection (URI). Subjects who reported that Facebook provoked anxiety/stress demonstrated a significantly higher number of URI than those not reporting Facebook-induced anxiety/stress and having more Facebook friends was associated with increased anxiety/stress and the number of URI. Users who demonstrated anxiety regarding their Facebook use were more likely to demonstrate a pattern of increased number of log-ins to Facebook/day and these anxiety-linked behavior patterns were associated with poorer health.

Fine-grained long-term forecasting enables many emerging recommendation applications such as forecasting the usage amounts of various apps to guide future investments, and forecasting users' seasonal demands for a certain commodity to find potential repeat buyers. For these applications, there often exists certain homogeneity in terms of similar users and items (e.g., apps), which also correlates with various contexts like users' spatial movements and physical environments. Most existing works only focus on predicting the upcoming situation such as the next used app or next online purchase, without considering the long-term temporal co-evolution of items and contexts and the homogeneity among all dimensions. In this paper, we propose a contextual collaborative forecasting (CCF) model to address the above issues. The model integrates contextual collaborative filtering with time series analysis, and simultaneously captures various components of temporal patterns, including trend, seasonality, and stationarity.

However, different from text, where sentiment analysis can use easily accessible semantic and context information, how to extract and interpret the sentiment of an image remains quite challenging.

This makes the sentiment classification results more interpretable than directly using the low-level features of an image. To obtain a better performance on images containing faces, we introduce eigenface-based facial expression detection as an additional mid-level attributes.

In recent years, forecast of unemployment rate attracts much attention from governments, organizations, and research institutes, and researchers. Recently, a novel method using search engine query data to forecast unemployment was proposed by scholars. In this paper, a data mining based framework using web information is introduced for unemployment rate prediction. Under the framework, a neural network method, as one of the most effective data mining tools, is developed to forecast unemployment trend using search engine query data. In the proposed method, search engine query data related with employment activities is firstly found. Secondly, feature selection models including correlation coefficient method and genetic algorithm are constructed to reduce the dimension of the query data. Thirdly, various neural networks are employed to model the relationship between unemployment rate data and query data. Fourthly, an optimal neural network is selected as the selective predictor by using the cross-validation method. Finally, the selective neural network predictor with the best feature subset is used to forecast unemployment trend. The empirical results show that the proposed method clearly outperforms the classical forecasting approaches for the unemployment rate prediction.

Purpose - Most studies on tie strength have focused on its definition, calculation and applications, but have not paid much attention to how tie strength can help analyse online social networks. Because ties play different roles in a network depending on their strength, the purpose of this paper is to explore the relationship between tie strength and network behaviours. Design/methodology/approach - The authors propose a simple metric for tie strength measurement and then apply it to an online social network extracted from a blog network. These networks are massive in size and have technology for efficient data collection, thereby presenting the possibility of measuring tie strength objectively. From the results several key social network properties are studied to see how tie strength may be used as a metric to explain certain characteristics in social networks. Findings - The online networks exhibit all the structural properties of an actual social network, not only in following the power law but also with regard to the distribution of tie strength. The authors noted a strong association between tie strength and reciprocity, and tie strength and transitivity in online social networks. Originality/value - This paper highlights the importance of analysing online social networks from a tie strength perspective.

We investigate to which extent parties attract supporters of Pegida, to which extent they address topics similar to Pegida and whether their topic use has become more similar over a period of almost two years. The empirical analysis is based on Facebook posts by main accounts and individual representatives of these political groups. We first show that there are considerable overlaps in the audiences of Pegida and the new challenger in the party system, AfD. Then we use topic models to characterize topic use by party and surveyed crowdworkers to which extent they perceive the identified topics as populist communication. The results show that while Pegida and AfD talk about rather unique topics and smaller parties engage to varying degrees with the topics populists emphasize, the two governing parties CDU and SPD clearly deemphasize those.

A lot of research has been done on sentiment analysis and opinion mining in these websites. However the number of research on using the data in the social media websites to predict the stock market price movement is limited.

This paper first presents a Chinese emotion mining approach and discusses whether the public emotions or opinions in the Chinese social media websites could be used to predict the stock market price in China. The experimental results demonstrate that the emotions automatically extracted from the large scale Weibo posts represent the real public opinions about some special topics of the stock market in China.

The selection of therapeutic targets is a critical aspect of antibody-drug conjugate research and development. In this study, we applied computational methods to select candidate targets overexpressed in three major breast cancer subtypes as compared with a range of vital organs and tissues. Microarray data corresponding to over 8,000 tissue samples were collected from the public domain. Breast cancer samples were classified into molecular subtypes using an iterative ensemble approach combining six classification algorithms and three feature selection techniques, including a novel kernel density-based method. This feature selection method was used in conjunction with differential expression and subcellular localization information to assemble a primary list of targets. A total of 50 cell membrane targets were identified, including one target for which an antibody-drug conjugate is in clinical use, and six targets for which antibody-drug conjugates are in clinical trials for the treatment of breast cancer and other solid tumors. In addition, 50 extracellular proteins were identified as potential targets for non-internalizing strategies and alternative modalities. Candidate targets linked with the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition were identified by analyzing differential gene expression in epithelial and mesenchymal tumor-derived cell lines. Overall, these results show that mining human gene expression data has the power to select and prioritize breast cancer antibody-drug conjugate targets, and the potential to lead to new and more effective cancer therapeutics.",2-s2.0-84962273565,0,2016,Oncotarget,1

First, the high costs of running frequent surveys mean that most survey questions are only asked occasionally making comparisons over time difficult. By contrast, Google Trends provides information on search trends measured weekly. Second, there are many countries where surveys are only conducted sporadically, whereas Google search data are available anywhere in the world where sufficient numbers of people use its search engine. The Google Trends website allows researchers to download data for almost all countries at no cost and to download time series of any search term's popularity over time (provided enough people have searched for it).

Background: Consumer health information technology (IT) solutions are designed to support patient health management and have the ability to facilitate patients' health information communication with their social networks. However, there is a need for consumer health IT solutions to align with patients' health management preferences for increased adoption of the technology. It may be possible to gain an understanding of patients' needs for consumer health IT supporting their health information communication with social networks by explicating how they have adopted and adapted social networking sites, such as Facebook, for this purpose. Objective: Our aim was to characterize patients' use of all communication mechanisms within Facebook for health information communication to provide insight into how consumer health IT solutions may be better designed to meet patients' communication needs and preferences. Methods: This study analyzed data about Facebook communication mechanisms use from a larger, three-phase, sequential, mixed-methods study. We report here on the results of the study's first phase: qualitative interviews (N=25). Participants were over 18, used Facebook, were residents or citizens of the United States, spoke English, and had a diagnosis consistent with type 2 diabetes. Participants were recruited through Facebook groups and pages. Participant interviews were conducted via Skype or telephone between July and September 2014. Data analysis was grounded in qualitative content analysis and the initial coding framework was informed by the findings of a previous study. Results: Participants' rationales for the use or disuse of a particular Facebook mechanism to communicate health information reflected six broad themes: (1) characteristics and circumstances of the person, (2) characteristics and circumstances of the relationship, (3) structure and composition of the social network, (4) content of the information, (5) communication purpose, and (6) attributes of the technology. Conclusions: The results of this study showed that participants consider multiple factors when choosing a Facebook mechanism for health information communication. Factors included what information they intended to share, what they were trying to accomplish, attributes of technology, and attributes and communication practices of their social networks. There is a need for consumer health IT that allows for a range of choices to suit the intersectionality of participants' rationales. Technology that better meets patients' needs may lead to better self-management of health conditions, and therefore, improve overall health outcomes.",2-s2.0-84989822977,0,2016,Journal of Medical Internet Research,1

In the last several years, the study of social networks analysis has gained much interest from the research community. An active research topic is to investigate the structure of social networks, i.e. studying the processes that affect the formation of relationships in a social network. One of the most fundamental notions governing the structure of social networks is homophily. This principle provides us with an illustration of how a network's surrounding contexts can drive the formation of its links. Given a particular characteristic of interest like religion, gender and individuals' connections, we concerned to answer to this question »does the network exhibits homophily according to individuals' characteristic?» For this purpose, we proposed a new method that uses fuzzy concepts to measure social network homophily. In contrast to the traditional approaches, our method handles non-deterministic information in homophily detection process. We applied our approach on a sample dataset drawn from CLOOB social network service.

Purpose: While a great amount of literature has focused on the relationship between communication strategies and corporate reputation, there is no systematic research on the different kinds of social media communication strategies. Based on the corporate reputation and social media literature, this paper aims to contribute to this gap in the research in two main ways. First identifying which social media communication strategy is more effective with contrasting levels of reputations; second, analyzing the differences between high- and low-reputation companies with respect to their ability to use corporate communication. Design/methodology/approach: This paper uses a longitudinal explorative multiple-case study and theoretical sampling. The research setting is the Italian insurance context. The focus of this analysis on one medium, Facebook, because it is the most exploited in the context of the Italian insurance sector. Findings: Six complementary social media communication strategies were identified: egocentric, conversational, selective, openness, secretive and supportive. The results also reveal distinct ways in which high-, medium- and low-reputation companies’ utilize the six complementary strategies of communications. Research limitations/implications: The study is based on a single industry and on one single geographical market, and care should thus be taken in generalizing the findings to other contexts. Therefore emerges the opportunity to broaden this research to other similar service sector, such as banking, to assess and generalize the results obtained. In addition, a possible direction of research, especially from a methodological standpoint, should investigate companies from different countries. Such a comparative study would examine in depth whether and to what extent the institutional framework may impact on communication strategies implemented by companies. This study only analyzed one social media (Facebook); hence, we cannot draw firm conclusions about what may constitute a successful social media communication strategy. Practical implications: From this study, managers can learn how to combine the six communication strategies to have an effective impact on the corporate reputation. They can also learn how the number of interactions and the time taken to respond to questions from customers improve the corporate reputation and provide communication that is more effective. Originality/value: This research extends the previous literature on corporate reputation and corporate communication, showing the relationship between them in a social media context and providing different strategies of managing this combination.",2-s2.0-84983527040,1,2016,Journal of Services Marketing,1

Learning of the information diffusion model is a fundamental problem in the study of information diffusion in social net- works.

Some of them may be caused by the social influence inside the network, while others may reect external trends in the \real world"". Most existing work on the learning of diffusion models does not distinguish the events caused by the social influence from those caused by external trends. In this paper, we extract social events from data streams in social networks, and then use the extracted social events to improve the learning of information diffusion models. We propose a LADP (Latent Action Diffusion Path) model to incorporate the information diffusion model with the model of external trends, and then design an EM-based algorithm to infer the diffusion probabilities, the external trends and the sources of events efficiently.

The consideration of the endogenous nature of online user reviews significantly changes the analysis. Our result shows that the rating of online user reviews has no significant impact on movies' box office revenues after accounting for the endogeneity, indicating that online user reviews have little persuasive effect on consumer purchase decisions. Nevertheless, we find that box office sales are significantly influenced by the volume of online posting, suggesting the importance of awareness effect. The finding of awareness effect for online user reviews is surprising as online reviews under the analysis are posted to the same website and are not expected to increase product awareness.

Google Trends, a Google Inc. portal, generates data on geographical and temporal patterns according to specified keywords. The aim of this study was to compare the reliability of Google Trends in different clinical settings, for both common diseases with lower media coverage, and for less common diseases attracting major media coverage. We carried out a search in Google Trends using the keywords “renal colic”, “epistaxis”, and “mushroom poisoning”, selected on the basis of available and reliable epidemiological data. Besides this search, we carried out a second search for three clinical conditions (i.e., “meningitis”, “Legionella Pneumophila pneumonia”, and “Ebola fever”), which recently received major focus by the Italian media. In our analysis, no correlation was found between data captured from Google Trends and epidemiology of renal colics, epistaxis and mushroom poisoning. Only when searching for the term “mushroom” alone the Google Trends search generated a seasonal pattern which almost overlaps with the epidemiological profile, but this was probably mostly due to searches for harvesting and cooking rather than to for poisoning. The Google Trends data also failed to reflect the geographical and temporary patterns of disease for meningitis, Legionella Pneumophila pneumonia and Ebola fever. The results of our study confirm that Google Trends has modest reliability for defining the epidemiology of relatively common diseases with minor media coverage, or relatively rare diseases with higher audience.

Social networks can profoundly affect human behavior, which is the primary force driving environmental change. However, empirical evidence linking microlevel social interactions to large-scale environmental outcomes has remained scarce. Here, we leverage comprehensive data on information-sharing networks among large-scale commercial tuna fishers to examine how social networks relate to shark bycatch, a global environmental issue. We demonstrate that the tendency for fishers to primarily share information within their ethnic group creates segregated networks that are strongly correlated with shark bycatch. However, some fishers share information across ethnic lines, and examinations of their bycatch rates show that network contacts are more strongly related to fishing behaviors than ethnicity. Our findings indicate that social networks are tied to actions that can directly impact marine ecosystems, and that biases toward within-group ties may impede the diffusion of sustainable behaviors. Importantly, our analysis suggests that enhanced communication channels across segregated fisher groups could have prevented the incidental catch of over 46,000 sharks between 2008 and 2012 in a single commercial fishery.",2-s2.0-84973394909,0,2016,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,1

Though online social network research has exploded during the past years, not much thought has been given to the exploration of the nature of social links. Online interactions have been interpreted as indicative of one social process or another (e.g., status exchange or trust), often with little systematic justification regarding the relation between observed data and theoretical concept. Our research aims to breach this gap in computational social science by proposing an unsupervised, parameter-free method to discover, with high accuracy, the fundamental domains of interaction occurring in social networks. By applying this method on two online datasets different by scope and type of interaction (aNobii and Flickr) we observe the spontaneous emergence of three domains of interaction representing the exchange of status, knowledge and social support. By finding significant relations between the domains of interaction and classic social network analysis issues (e.g., tie strength, dyadic interaction over time) we show how the network of interactions induced by the extracted domains can be used as a starting point for more nuanced analysis of online social data that may one day incorporate the normative grammar of social interaction. Our methods finds applications in online social media services ranging from recommendation to visual link summarization.

Sentiment analysis or opinion mining is becoming an open research domain due to the abundance of discussion forums, Weblogs, e-commerce portals, social networking and content sharing sites where people tend to express their opinions. Sentiment Analysis involves classifying text documents based on the opinion expressed being positive or negative about a given topic. This paper proposes a sentiment classification model using back-propagation artificial neural network (BPANN). Information Gain and three popular sentiment lexicons are used to extract sentiment representing features that are then used to train and test the BPANN. This novel approach combines the strength of BPANN in classification accuracy with utilizing intrinsic domain knowledge available in the sentiment lexicons.

Recently, the content-based publish/subscribe (pub/sub) paradigm is gaining popularity in opportunistic mobile networks (OppNets) for its flexibility and adaptability. Since nodes in OppNets is controlled by humans, they often behave selfishly with an aim to maximize their own revenues without considering the performance of others. Therefore, stimulating nodes in OppNets to collect, store, and share content efficiently is one of the key challenges under this scheme. Meanwhile, guaranteeing the freshness of content is also a big problem for content dissemination in OppNets. In this paper, in order to solve these problems, we propose an incentive-driven and freshness-aware pub/sub content dissemination scheme, called ConDis (Content Dissemination), for selfish OppNets. In ConDis, the Tit-For-Tat (TFT) scheme is employed to deal with selfish behaviors of nodes in OppNets. ConDis also implements a novel content exchange protocol when nodes are in contact. Specifically, during each contact, the exchange order is determined by the content utility, which is calculated by the direct subscribed value and the indirect subscribed value, and the objective of nodes is to maximize the utility of the content inventory stored in their buffer. Extensive realistic trace-driven simulation results show that ConDis is superior to other existing schemes in terms of total freshness value, total delivered contents, and total transmission cost.",2-s2.0-84893252799,1,2013,"Proceedings - IEEE 10th International Conference on Mobile Ad-Hoc and Sensor Systems, MASS 2013",1

In recent years, the 'power of the crowd' has been repeatedly demonstrated and various Internet platforms have been used to applied collaborative intelligence to areas that range from open innovation to image analysis. However, crowdsourcing applications in the fields of design research and creative innovation have been much slower to emerge. So, although there have been reports of systems and researchers using Internet crowdsourcing to carry out generative design, there are still many gaps in knowledge about the capability and limitations of the technology. For example on crowdsourcing platforms, like Amazon's Mechanical Turk, the relationship between remuneration and the final quality of designs has not been established, so it is unclear how much payment should be offered to ensure a particular standard of result. To investigate the relationship between the crowd's remuneration and the quality of their innovation, this paper reports how payment for a 2D interior design task (living room layout) was systematically varied and the quality of the output assessed by a ranking process that was also crowdsourced. Information about individual Mturk workers who participated in the study was also collected. The results suggest that while average design quality only slowly increases, the quality of the 'best' design generated by the crowd improved dramatically with payment levels. In other words, increasing monetary rewards does not improve the average creativity of design but rather it increases the chance of an excellent solution being generated by an individual in the crowd.",2-s2.0-84904609211,1,2014,"Proceedings of the 2014 IEEE 18th International Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work in Design, CSCWD 2014",1

However, as an unavoidable topic, the predictability of travel time series is the basic premise for travel time prediction, which has received less attention than the methodology.

Multiscale entropy is employed to quantify the complexity of the travel time series, and the relationships between entropy and the upper bound of travel time predictability are presented. Empirical studies are made with vehicle trajectory data in an express road section to shape the features of travel time predictability. The effectiveness of time scales, tolerance, and series length to entropy and travel time predictability are analyzed, and some valuable suggestions about the accuracy of travel time predictability are discussed. Finally, comparisons between travel time predictability and actual prediction results from two prediction models, ARIMA and BPNN, are made.

Classifying only positive and negative tweets has been exploited in depth, whereas analyzing finer emotions is still a difficult task. More elaborate emotion lexicons should be developed to deal with this problem, but existing lexicon sets are mostly in English. Moreover, building such lexicons is known to be extremely laborintensive or resource-intensive. Finer-grained features need to be taken into account when determining finer-emotions, but many existing works still utilize coarse features that have been widely used in analyzing only the polarity of emotion. In this paper, we present a method to automatically build fine-grained emotion lexicon sets and suggest features that improve the performance of machine learning based emotion classification in Korean Twitter texts.",2-s2.0-84967104294,1,2015,"29th Pacific Asia Conference on Language, Information and Computation, PACLIC 2015",1

In Nigeria, the growth in mobile phone use has provided the opportunity for increased access to the internet, and through this, the social media. The social media in turn offers tremendous communication benefits but also results in some undesirable consequences. One of such is the experience of Gender-Based Violence (GBV). Internet searches using Google Search and Google Scholar in addition to information available to the authors from news media is reported in this study. Five cases were selected for reporting. All cases selected had first contact with their perpetrator(s) on Facebook. The perpetrators were usually men, older than the victims (24-34 years for perpetrators compared with 17-25 years for the victims). The victims experienced physical, psychological, sexual and economic violence from their aggressors. One case resulted in the death of the victim, while two required hospitalization following severe trauma. Three of the victims were raped, while rape was attempted for the other two cases. GBV associated with acquaintances made on social media channels is emerging as a new social problem in Nigeria.

Predicting plausible links that may emerge between pairs of nodes is an important task in social network analysis, with over a decade of active research. Here, we propose a novel framework for link prediction. It integrates signals from node features, the existing local link neighborhood of a node pair, community-level link density, and global graph properties. Our framework uses a stacked two-level learning paradigm. At the lower level, the first two kinds of features are processed by a novel local learner. Its outputs are then integrated with the last two kinds of features by a conventional discriminative learner at the upper-level. We also propose a new stratified sampling scheme for evaluating link prediction algorithms in the face of an extremely large number of potential edges, out of which very few will ever materialize. It is not tied to a specific application of link prediction, but robust to a range of application requirements. We report on extensive experiments with seven benchmark datasets and over five competitive baseline systems. The system we present consistently shows at least 10 percent accuracy improvement over state-of-the-art, and over 30 percent improvement in some cases. We also demonstrate, through ablation, that our features are complementary in terms of the signals and accuracy benefits they provide.",2-s2.0-84978696622,1,2016,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,1

Similarity breeds connections, the principle of homophily, has been well studied in existing sociology literature. Several studies have observed this phenomenon by conducting surveys on human subjects. These studies have concluded that new ties are formed between similar individuals. This phenomenon has been used to explain several socio-psychological concepts such as segregation, community development, social mobility, etc. However, due to the nature of these studies and limitations because of involvement of human subjects, conclusions from these studies are not easily extensible in online social media. Social media, which is becoming the infinite space for interactions, has exceeded all the expectations in terms of growth, for reasons beyond human comprehension. New ties are formed in social media in the same way that they emerge in the real world. However, given the differences between real-world and online social media, do the same factors that govern the construction of new ties in the real world also govern the construction of new ties in social media? In other words, does homophily exist in social media? In this chapter, the authors study this highly significant question and propose a systematic approach by studying two online social media sites, BlogCatalog and Last.fm, and report our findings along with some interesting observations.",2-s2.0-84898386706,0,2011,"Social Network Mining, Analysis, and Research Trends: Techniques and Applications",1

However, there is limited research that looks into the effects that sharing biometric data with others could have on one's social network. Following a period of research on existing mobile applications and prototype testing, we developed a system, HeartLink, which collects real-time personal biometric data such as heart rate and broadcasts this data online. Insights gained on designing systems to broadcast real-time biometric data are presented. In this paper we also report emerging results from testing HeartLink in a pilot study and a user study that were conducted during sport events. The results showed that sharing heart rate data does influence the relationship of the persons involved and that the degree of influence seems related to the tie strength prior to visualizing the data.

Networks have constantly been in the focus of research for the past decade, with considerable advances in the description of their structural and dynamical properties. However, much less effort has been devoted to studying the controllability of the dynamics taking place on them. Here we introduce and evaluate a dynamical process defined on the edges of a network, and demonstrate that the controllability properties of this process significantly differ from simple nodal dynamics. Evaluation of real-world networks indicates that most of them are more controllable than their randomized counterparts. We also find that transcriptional regulatory networks are particularly easy to control. Analytic calculations show that networks with scale-free degree distributions have better controllability properties than uncorrelated networks, and positively correlated in- and out-degrees enhance the controllability of the proposed dynamics.",2-s2.0-84863449762,1,2012,Nature Physics,1

This paper looks at instances of second person narration in the first journal published in The Unabridged Journals of Sylvia Plath (Kukil, 2000) in order to determine the potential that second person narration can have for the linguistic representation of mental states. The contributions of different disciplines (narratology, linguistics, psychology) to the study of second person narration are considered and their findings are re-applied to a non-fictional text. In a corpus-informed comparative analysis, the paper takes into consideration both perspectives from narratology and developments in the understanding of language use in the field of psychology to provide an interdisciplinary, but cognitively inclined perspective on the phenomenon. Appearances of second person narration are chronologically tracked through the data and compared to biographical developments in Sylvia Plath's life; entries written in the first- and second person are compared to each other to determine linguistic differences using corpus methods; the results of the two analyses are then interpreted in the light of traditional functions attributed to second person narration in narratology, and in the light of research in narrative psychology. The paper aims to demonstrate that second person narration can project a sense of emotional depth and inner conflict as well as of emotional balance.

Proper discussion and usage of context requires an unambiguous statement of how the term is understood in the particular case.

According to our simulation results, the probability increases that the network's average shortest-path length is between 3 and 4, if most of the dynamic processes are based on random link formations. That means, in Facebook, the existing average shortest path length of 4.7 can even shrink to smaller values.

Recent outbreaks of a novel avian influenza A virus (H5N1) in Asia, Africa and Europe were a chilling reminder that another human pandemic may occur any time. Such a worldwide outbreak will cause intense human suffering, disruption of social systems, major economic losses, and greatly burden health care services. Several pandemics during the last century, like the 'Spanish flu' (1918), the 'Asian flu' (1957), the 'Hong Kong flu' (1968) and SARS (2003) prompted health care authorities for preparedness planning. In The Netherlands the risk of pandemic influenza was stressed by the outbreak of H7N7 which led to culling 30 million chickens (one third of domestic poultry), and with one human casualty, a veterinary surgeon. The influenza pandemic alertness was elevated to Phase 3 by the World Health Organization in 2005. In the Netherlands these events forced health care authorities and health care services to draft and discuss national and regional preparedness plans. In November 2007, the northern part of the Netherlands was confronted with a sudden and -mysterious"" disease outbreak in an (exotic) animal's pet store. As there was uncertainty about the nature of this sudden outbreak - infectious, toxic or otherwise - all patients were admitted for quarantine and overnight observation to the University Medical Centre Groningen (UMCG), acting as the regional centre for outbreak management and trauma care. In 2008 a woman died in The Netherlands due to Marburg Haemorrhagic Fever which was acquired during a visit to Uganda. She returned to the Netherlands in good health but after the first symptoms she was admitted to the hospital and deteriorated rapidly with liver failure and severe haemorrhage. These recent incidents emphasise the need for more structured planning and preparation for medical emergencies such as emerging infectious disease outbreaks. Structured planning and preparation for disease outbreaks is not yet common ground for most health services, including hospitals and large tertiary referral centres in affluent countries. It demands commitment from health care services ranging from the level of individual health care workers to government level to provide sufficient strategic decision making and financial resources. It also demands a cultural change in thinking for management and recognizing the ethical impact this has on clinicians and nurses who have to make these decisions. Many clinicians now realize that end-of-life decisions are an integral part of health care which is independent of any specific religious background or culture. With appropriate patient management adequate health care can be provided even during infectious disease outbreaks. Evidence-based medicine and modelling in preparing for disease outbreaks has to be followed by evidence-based management of the health care systems which includes using disease outbreaks models and knowledge about surge capacity on regional, national and international level, to ensure business continuity of the health care system. Business continuity encompasses ethical decisions (use of surge capacity), finances, and preparation (hospital layout). Decision rules have to be adapted to real-time information updates obtained during the course of an outbreak and exchange of information throughout the crisis is pivotal.",2-s2.0-84896573842,0,2010,"Handbook of Disease Outbreaks: Prevention, Detection and Control",1
877,15370,Kehrberg A.K.,"‘I love you, please notice me’: the hierarchical rhetoric of Twitter fandom","‘I love you, please notice me’: the hierarchical rhetoric of Twitter fandom. Since its 2006 debut, Twitter has emerged as the primary online space for communication between celebrity and audience. Yet scholars are conflicted on whether Twitter’s expanded interaction is actual or merely perceived. Some contend that the social media site represents a democratised public square in which the borders between ordinary and extraordinary are flattened, while others argue that Twitter encompasses synthetic personalisation: hierarchical power dynamics masked by simulated interconnection. Assuming that Twitter communication is an extension of traditions of letter-writing by fans and fan clubs, this study utilises a framework for rhetorical arrangement drawn from medieval work on the ars dictaminis, or the art of letter-writing. Informed by Cicero, the ars dictaminis divided the letter into five parts, including exordium (opening), captatio benevolentiae (capturing of goodwill), narratio (background), petitio (petition/request), and conclusio (conclusion). Tweets directed at the top five most-followed Twitter accounts (Justin Bieber, Katy Perry, Barack Obama, Rihanna, and Taylor Swift) are classified by which of the ars dictaminis elements they accomplish. The findings suggest that, given the limitations of the medium, Twitter users focus on captatio benevolentiae and petitio in addressing stars. It is particularly startling that users often construct their Twitter handles as a reference to the star, thereby soliciting goodwill in the rhetorical space of message sender rather than content.

In citizen journalism, the citizens that used to form the mass audience utilize IT artifacts such as smart phones and social media to inform each other and the broader public. Previous research has highlighted how citizen journalism published on independent web-based platforms can substitute (or complement) traditional news publishing, and illuminated the challenges of integrating elements of citizen journalism into mainstream news organizations. Still, less is known about how self-organized citizen journalism processes emerge and evolve. The paper draws on complexity theory in a detailed analysis of an online forum thread in which users collaboratively investigated and published detailed information about a local murder case. The paper makes two main contributions to the literature on citizen journalism. Firstly, it demonstrates the efficacy of using a complexity perspective. Secondly, it illustrates and theorizes the ways in which IT-based citizen journalism was self-organized via a specific online forum through sequenced interaction themes.",2-s2.0-84944242519,1,2015,Proceedings of the Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences,1
880,5084,"Underwood M.K., Ehrenreich S.E.",The power and the pain of adolescents' digital communication: Cyber victimization and the perils of lurking,"The power and the pain of adolescents' digital communication: Cyber victimization and the perils of lurking. Many adolescents are heavily engaged with social media and text messaging (George and Odgers, 2015; Lenhart, 2015), yet few psychologists have studied what digital communication means for adolescents' relationships and adjustment. This article proposes that psychologists should embrace the careful study of adolescents' digital communication. We discuss theoretical frameworks for understanding adolescents' involvement with social media, present less widely recognized perils of intense involvement with social media, and highlight positive features of digital communication. Coconstruction theory suggests that adolescents help to create the content of digital communication that shapes their lives, and that there may be strong continuity between adolescents' offline and online lives (Subrahmanyam, Smahel, Greenfield, 2006). However, psychological theories and research methods could further illuminate the power and the pain of adolescents' digital communication. Psychologists need to understand more about subtle but potentially serious risks that adolescents might face: The agony of victimization by even a single episode of cyberbullying and the pain of social exclusion and comparison resulting from vast amounts of time reading large social media feeds and seeing friends doing things without you and comparing your inner emotional experience to everyone else's highly groomed depictions of their seemingly marvelous lives. If we seek to understand developmental psychopathology and to help youth at risk, psychologists need to embrace careful study of the content of adolescents' online communication, parents need to talk with their children about their own online experiences and become familiar with social media themselves, and clinicians need to address adolescents' online social lives in prevention and treatment programs.",2-s2.0-85013427619,0,2017,American Psychologist,1
881,11490,"Sagduyu Y.E., Shi Y.",Navigating a mobile social network,"Navigating a mobile social network. With the emergence of mobile social networks, there has been an increasing interest in studying the methods of using social network connections, such as social network-aware routing, to improve the performance of communication networks. This raises the need for new models of combined social and communication networks with realistic link reliability and mobility properties. Going beyond graph analysis of social networks, such models are useful to have a better understanding of the algorithmic aspects in mobile social networking, for example, how to navigate a mobile social network and search for users with local information. The first step toward this goal is to develop a combined social and communication network model, where wireless communication becomes the underlay to route information with the aid of social connections. Random patterns of node mobility are included in this combined model, which is then used to analyze the average delay of search paths between source-destination pairs. By applying greedy routing over the combined network, analytical expressions are obtained to evaluate the average delay as a function of separation between source-destination pairs. The results quantify the dependence of the average delay on network mobility and on the combined use of social and communication links. Search paths are typically prone to link failures due to message drops in social and communication links. Therefore, the network model is extended with probabilistic link failures, and analytical expressions are obtained for success probability on search paths. The analysis of average delay and success probability shows how social connections can be used to reduce end-to-end delay and increase end-to-end success probability in a mobile social network.",2-s2.0-84946547750,1,2015,IEEE Wireless Communications,1

This paper is written for (social science) researchers seeking to analyze the wealth of social media now available. It presents a comprehensive review of software tools for social networking media, wikis, really simple syndication feeds, blogs, newsgroups, chat and news feeds. For completeness, it also includes introductions to social media scraping, storage, data cleaning and sentiment analysis. Although principally a review, the paper also provides a methodology and a critique of social media tools. Analyzing social media, in particular Twitter feeds for sentiment analysis, has become a major research and business activity due to the availability of web-based application programming interfaces (APIs) provided by Twitter, Facebook and News services. This has led to an ‘explosion’ of data services, software tools for scraping and analysis and social media analytics platforms. It is also a research area undergoing rapid change and evolution due to commercial pressures and the potential for using social media data for computational (social science) research. Using a simple taxonomy, this paper provides a review of leading software tools and how to use them to scrape, cleanse and analyze the spectrum of social media. In addition, it discussed the requirement of an experimental computational environment for social media research and presents as an illustration the system architecture of a social media (analytics) platform built by University College London. The principal contribution of this paper is to provide an overview (including code fragments) for scientists seeking to utilize social media scraping and analytics either in their research or business. The data retrieval techniques that are presented in this paper are valid at the time of writing this paper (June 2014), but they are subject to change since social media data scraping APIs are rapidly changing.",2-s2.0-84922001946,0,2014,AI and Society,1

Based on the pointed outlines, the aim is to evaluate longitudinally the types of social media used by pre-adults, the contexts in which they use each social media type, their opinions about the intentions of social media marketing and the influences of social media marketing on their brand knowledge, attitude and behaviour. Tendencies around concepts, tools and levels of attraction by the audiences, with focus on relationship marketing in the 2.0 era are revisited.

Understanding of the mechanisms driving our daily face-to-face encounters is still limited; the field lacks large-scale datasets describing both individual behaviors and their collective interactions. However, here, with the help of travel smart card data, we uncover such encounter mechanisms and structures by constructing a time-resolved in-vehicle social encounter network on public buses in a city (about 5 million residents). Using a population scale dataset, we find physical encounters display reproducible temporal patterns, indicating that repeated encounters are regular and identical. On an individual scale, we find that collective regularities dominate distinct encounters' bounded nature. An individual's encounter capability is rooted in his/her daily behavioral regularity, explaining the emergence of ""familiar strangers"" in daily life. Strikingly, we find individuals with repeated encounters are not grouped into small communities, but become strongly connected over time, resulting in a large, but imperceptible, small-world contact network or ""structure of co-presence"" across the whole metropolitan area. Revealing the encounter pattern and identifying this large-scale contact network are crucial to understanding the dynamics in patterns of social acquaintances, collective human behaviors, and - particularly - disclosing the impact of human behavior on various diffusion/spreading processes.",2-s2.0-84882800907,0,2013,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,1

Background: Mental illness is quickly becoming one of the most prevalent public health problems worldwide. Social network platforms, where users can express their emotions, feelings, and thoughts, are a valuable source of data for researching mental health, and techniques based on machine learning are increasingly used for this purpose. Objective: The objective of this review was to explore the scope and limits of cutting-edge techniques that researchers are using for predictive analytics in mental health and to review associated issues, such as ethical concerns, in this area of research. Methods: We performed a systematic literature review in March 2017, using keywords to search articles on data mining of social network data in the context of common mental health disorders, published between 2010 and March 8, 2017 in medical and computer science journals. Results: The initial search returned a total of 5386 articles. Following a careful analysis of the titles, abstracts, and main texts, we selected 48 articles for review. We coded the articles according to key characteristics, techniques used for data collection, data preprocessing, feature extraction, feature selection, model construction, and model verification. The most common analytical method was text analysis, with several studies using different flavors of image analysis and social interaction graph analysis. Conclusions: Despite an increasing number of studies investigating mental health issues using social network data, some common problems persist.

Various studies have proposed the possibility of inferring public opinion based on digital trace data collected on Twitter and even the possibility to predict election results based on aggregates of mentions of political actors. Yet, a systematic attempt at a validation of Twitter as an indicator for political support is lacking. In this article, building on social science methodology, we test the validity of the relationship between various Twitter-based metrics of public attention toward politics with election results and opinion polls. All indicators tested in this article suggest caution in the attempt to infer public opinion or predict election results based on Twitter messages. In all tested metrics, indicators based on Twitter mentions of political parties differed strongly from parties’ results in elections or opinion polls. This leads us to question the power of Twitter to infer levels of political support of political actors.

We then refine the emotion categories to a set of 28 and test how representative they are on a larger set of 10,000 tweets through crowdsourcing. We describe the two-phase methodology used to expose and refine the set of fine-grained emotion categories from tweets, compare the inter-annotator agreement between annotations generated by expert and novice annotators (crowdsourcing) and show that it is feasible to perform fine-grained emotion classification using gold standard data generated from these two phases.

Political debate concerning moralized issues is increasingly common in online social networks. However, moral psychology has yet to incorporate the study of social networks to investigate processes by which some moral ideas spread more rapidly or broadly than others. Here, we show that the expression of moral emotion is key for the spread of moral and political ideas in online social networks, a process we call ""moral contagion."" Using a large sample of social media communications about three polarizing moral/political issues (n = 563,312), we observed that the presence of moral-emotional words in messages increased their diffusion by a factor of 20% for each additional word. Furthermore, we found that moral contagion was bounded by group membership; moral-emotional language increased diffusion more strongly within liberal and conservative networks, and less between them. Our results highlight the importance of emotion in the social transmission of moral ideas and also demonstrate the utility of social network methods for studying morality. These findings offer insights into how people are exposed to moral and political ideas through social networks, thus expanding models of social influence and group polarization as people become increasingly immersed in social media networks.",2-s2.0-85023165773,1,2017,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,1

Context: Individuals' personality traits have been shown to influence their behavior during team work. In particular, positive group attitudes are said to be essential for distributed and global software development efforts where collaboration is critical to project success. Objective: Given this, we have sought to study the influence of global software practitioners' personality profiles from a psycholinguistic perspective. Method: Artifacts from ten teams were selected from the IBM Rational Jazz repository and mined. We employed social network analysis (SNA) techniques to identify and group practitioners into two clusters based on the numbers of messages they communicated, Top Members and Others, and used standard statistical techniques to assess practitioners' engagement in task changes associated with work items. We then performed psycholinguistic analysis on practitioners' messages using linguistic dimensions of the LIWC tool that had been previously correlated with the Big Five personality profiles. Results: For our sample of 146 practitioners, we found that the Top Members demonstrated more openness to experience than the Other practitioners. Additionally, practitioners involved in usability-related tasks were found to be highly extroverted, and coders were most neurotic and conscientious. Conclusion: High levels of organizational and inter-personal skills may be useful for those operating in distributed settings, and personality diversity is likely to boost team performance.

Many firms are developing application-based mobile services (ABMS) as a complementary channel to their online service. Although perceptions of the ABMS determine trust in the ABMS, trust transfer from the online channel plays a role in the formation of ABMS trust. Applying the elaboration likelihood model (ELM) to the study, two objectives were pursued: (1) to investigate the role different influence processes play in the formation of ABMS trust and (2) to assess whether the effects of these influences vary across users, and if so, how. Data collected from 344 users of the online services of a price-comparison service also offering an ABMS were analysed. Based on the ELM, central and peripheral routes of information processing were identified in the formation of ABMS trust. The central routes of information processing that play a role are the influence of online-service trust and ABMS perceived usefulness on ABMS trust, while the influence of ABMS perceived ease-of-use on ABMS trust emerged as a peripheral cue. Furthermore, online-service trust is also a peripheral cue for ABMS perceived ease-of-use. Other theoretical contributions offered by this study are findings that show that ABMS self-efficacy and online-service use influence information processing, but use different ELM routes.",2-s2.0-85014738732,1,2017,Behaviour and Information Technology,1

Purpose. Assessing the potential link between smoking behavior and exposure to mass media depictions of smoking on social networking Web sites. Design. A representative longitudinal panel of 200 young adults in Connecticut. Setting. Telephone surveys were conducted by using computer assisted telephone interviewing technology and electronic dialing for random digit dialing and listed samples. Subjects. Connecticut residents aged 18 to 24 years. Measures. To measure encoded exposure, respondents were asked whether or not they had smoked a cigarette in the past 30 days and about how often they had seen tobacco use on television, in movies, and in social media content. Respondents were also asked about cigarette use in the past 30 days, and a series of additional questions that have been shown to be predictive of tobacco use. Analysis. Logistic regression was used to test for our main prediction that reported exposure to social media tobacco depictions at time 1 would influence time 2 smoking behavior. Results. Encoded exposure to social media tobacco depictions (B = .47, p < .05) was a significant predictor of time 2 smoking, even after controlling for all the aforementioned predictors. Conclusion. Our results suggest that social media depictions of tobacco use predict future smoking tendency, over and above the influence of TV and movie depictions of smoking. This is the first known study to specifically assess the role of social media in informing tobacco behavior. Copyright",2-s2.0-84924979806,0,2015,American Journal of Health Promotion,1

Background: Social media have transformed the communications landscape. People increasingly obtain news and health information online and via social media. Social media platforms also serve as novel sources of rich observational data for health research (including infodemiology, infoveillance, and digital disease detection detection). While the number of studies using social data is growing rapidly, very few of these studies transparently outline their methods for collecting, filtering, and reporting those data. Keywords and search filters applied to social data form the lens through which researchers may observe what and how people communicate about a given topic. Without a properly focused lens, research conclusions may be biased or misleading. Standards of reporting data sources and quality are needed so that data scientists and consumers of social media research can evaluate and compare methods and findings across studies. Objective: We aimed to develop and apply a framework of social media data collection and quality assessment and to propose a reporting standard, which researchers and reviewers may use to evaluate and compare the quality of social data across studies. Methods: We propose a conceptual framework consisting of three major steps in collecting social media data: develop, apply, and validate search filters. This framework is based on two criteria: retrieval precision (how much of retrieved data is relevant) and retrieval recall (how much of the relevant data is retrieved). We then discuss two conditions that estimation of retrieval precision and recall rely on-accurate human coding and full data collection-and how to calculate these statistics in cases that deviate from the two ideal conditions. We then apply the framework on a real-world example using approximately 4 million tobacco-related tweets collected from the Twitter firehose. Results: We developed and applied a search filter to retrieve e-cigarette-related tweets from the archive based on three keyword categories: devices, brands, and behavior. The search filter retrieved 82,205 e-cigarette-related tweets from the archive and was validated. Retrieval precision was calculated above 95% in all cases. Retrieval recall was 86% assuming ideal conditions (no human coding errors and full data collection), 75% when unretrieved messages could not be archived, 86% assuming no false negative errors by coders, and 93% allowing both false negative and false positive errors by human coders. Conclusions: This paper sets forth a conceptual framework for the filtering and quality evaluation of social data that addresses several common challenges and moves toward establishing a standard of reporting social data. Researchers should clearly delineate data sources, how data were accessed and collected, and the search filter building process and how retrieval precision and recall were calculated. The proposed framework can be adapted to other public social media platforms.",2-s2.0-84962081670,1,2016,Journal of Medical Internet Research,1

Web Geographic Information System (Web GIS) has been extensively and successfully exploited in various arenas. However, to date, the application of this technology in public health surveillance has yet to be systematically explored in the Web 2.0 era. We reviewed existing Web GIS-based Public Health Surveillance Systems (WGPHSSs) and assessed them based on 20 indicators adapted from previous studies. The indicators comprehensively cover various aspects of WGPHSS development, including metadata, data, cartography, data analysis, and technical aspects. Our literature search identified 58 relevant journal articles and 27 eligible WGPHSSs. Analyses of results revealed that WGPHSSs were frequently used for infectious-disease surveillance, and that geographical and performance inequalities existed in their development. The latest Web and Web GIS technologies have been used in developing WGPHSSs; however, significant deficiencies in data analysis, system compatibility, maintenance, and accessibility exist. A balance between public health surveillance and privacy concerns has yet to be struck. Use of news and social media as well as Web-user searching records as data sources, participatory public health surveillance, collaborations among health sectors at different spatial levels and among various disciplines, adaption or reuse of existing WGPHSSs, and adoption of geomashup and open-source development models were identified as the directions for advancing WGPHSSs..",2-s2.0-84948767616,1,2014,ISPRS International Journal of Geo-Information,1

The past few years have witnessed millions of credit/debit cards flowing through the underground economy and ultimately causing significant financial loss. Examining key underground economy sellers has both practical and academic significance for cybercrime forensics and criminology research. Drawing on social media analytics, we have developed the AZSecure text mining system for identifying and profiling key sellers. The system identifies sellers using sentiment analysis of customer reviews and profiles sellers using topic modeling of advertisements. We evaluated the AZSecure system on eight international underground economy forums. The system significantly outperformed all benchmark machine-learning methods on identifying advertisement threads, classifying customer review sentiments, and profiling seller characteristics, with an average F-measure of about 80 percent to 90 percent. In our case study, we identified the famous carder, Rescator, who was affiliated with the Target breach, and captured important seller characteristics in terms of product type, payment options, and contact channels. Our research leverages social media analytics to probe into the underground economy in order to help law enforcement target key sellers and prevent future fraud.

SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered) is a general and widely-used diffusion model that can model the diffusion in different contexts such as idea spreading and disease propagation. Here, we tackle the problem of inferring graph edges if we can only observe a SEIR diffusion process spreading over the nodes of a graph. This problem is of importance in the common case where node states can be estimated with less cost than the edges can be found. Some applications include inferring a contact network from disease spread data, inferring a reference network from idea spreading, or estimating influenza diffusion rates between U.S. states. We improve upon the existing approaches for this problem in three ways: (1) we assume we are provided only with the probabilistic information about the state of each node which may also be undersampled or incomplete; (2) we present a more general framework that better uses trace data to model edge non-existence under SEIR model; (3) we can infer the network at both micro and macro scales. Experiments on both real and synthetic data show that our method is accurate under these challenging cases at multiple scales, and it performs consistently better than the existing methods. For instance, we can infer a high school human contact network at microscale by tracking influenza diffusion almost 10% better than the existing methods as well as the estimated networks closely mimick the full range of properties of the true network. We also estimated the strength of the influenza diffusion between and inside the U.S. states from Google Flu Trends data at macroscale. Estimated rates are correlated with the human transportation rates between the states to a certain degree, and we gain interesting insight into the influenza diffusion in U.S. such as the importance of the less populous states in epidemics as well as the asymmetric influenza diffusion between U.S. states.",2-s2.0-84940844072,1,2015,Proceedings - International Conference on Data Engineering,1

It is an undeniable fact that penetration level and usage and sales of Smartphone dramatically increased past few years, whereby; it has increased to almost 60 percent of total population. Despite the high penetration of smartphone, previous studies have exhibited inconsistent findings towards understanding the behavioural intention to use smartphone especially among university students. Thus, the purpose of this study is to examine purchasing behaviour of Smartphone among students. From the literature, five antecedents of purchasing behaviour were identified. Each variable is measured using 7-point Likert scale: convenience (10 items), social influence (6 items), self-efficacy (10 items), facilitating condition (11 items), dependency (14 items) and purchasing behaviour (4 items). Using the primary data collection method, 400 questionnaires were distributed to the target respondents of one of the public higher education in the northern region. The responses collected were 350 completed questionnaires representing 87.5 percent response rate. The data were analysed using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) using AMOS. Confirmatory factor analysis of measurement models indicates adequate goodness or fit after few items were eliminated through modification indices verifications. Therefore, goodness of fit for the generated structural model shows the adequate fit. This study has established four direct significant causal effects and two significant mediating effects: (1) convenience and dependency, (2) social influence and dependency, (3) facilitating condition and purchase behaviour, (4), dependency and purchase behaviour. The significant mediating results are: (1). Dependency mediates the relationship between convenience and purchase behaviour; (2) dependency mediates social influence and purchase behaviour. Thus, findings suggested that convenience, social influence and dependency play a role in determining students purchase behaviour of smartphone.

Syndromic surveillance is defined as based on automation of recording and transfer of data for professional use. A number of systems that were developed initially did not survive. Those that are still in use are those integrated a public health approach through large scale surveillance and with a significant implication of official organizations in sanitary surveillance.

We propose a practical methodology to protect a user's private data, when he wishes to publicly release data that is correlated with his private data, to get some utility. Our approach relies on a general statistical inference framework that captures the privacy threat under inference attacks, given utility constraints. Under this framework, data is distorted before it is released, according to a probabilistic privacy mapping. This mapping is obtained by solving a convex optimization problem, which minimizes information leakage under a distortion constraint. We address practical challenges encountered when applying this theoretical framework to real world data. On one hand, the design of optimal privacy mappings requires knowledge of the prior distribution linking private data and data to be released, which is often unavailable in practice. On the other hand, the optimization may become untractable when data assumes values in large size alphabets, or is high dimensional. Our work makes three major contributions. First, we provide bounds on the impact of a mismatched prior on the privacy-utility tradeoff. Second, we show how to reduce the optimization size by introducing a quantization step, and how to generate privacy mappings under quantization. Third, we evaluate our method on two datasets, including a new dataset that we collected, showing correlations between political convictions and TV viewing habits. We demonstrate that good privacy properties can be achieved with limited distortion so as not to undermine the original purpose of the publicly released data, e.g., recommendations.",2-s2.0-84942258695,1,2015,IEEE Journal on Selected Topics in Signal Processing,1

Let the revolution begin….- Duncan Watts (2012, p. 266) Online interaction is now a regular part of daily life for a demographically diverse population of billions of people worldwide. Facebook and Twitter are two of the most popular places where these interactions take place. A key difference is that most content on Twitter is publicly accessible via the Twitter API or through data resellers such as GNIP and Datasift, whereas most Facebook content is private. Thus, Twitter has emerged as the single most powerful ""socioscope"" available to social scientists for collecting fine-grained time-stamped records of human behavior and social interaction at the level of individual events. These data are also global in scale, allowing researchers to address fundamental questions about social identity, status, conflict, cooperation, collective action, and diffusion. This unprecedented opportunity comes with a number of methodological challenges, including generalizing observations to the offline world, protecting individual privacy, and solving the logistical challenges posed by ""big data."" This introductory chapter reviews current advances in online social research and critically assesses the theoretical and methodological opportunities and limitations. Opportunities and Challenges for Online Social Research Scientific disciplines make revolutionary advances not only through new discoveries, theories, and paradigms, but also because of the invention of new tools and methodologies (Kuhn, 1962).

Social systems have recently attracted much attention, with attempts to understand social behavior with the aid of statistical mechanics applied to complex systems. Collective properties of such systems emerge from couplings between components, for example, individual persons, transportation nodes such as airports or subway stations, and administrative districts. Among various collective properties, criticality is known as a characteristic property of a complex system, which helps the systems to respond flexibly to external perturbations. This work considers the criticality of the urban transportation system entailed in the massive smart card data on the Seoul transportation network. Analyzing the passenger flow on the Seoul bus system during one week, we find explicit power-law correlations in the system, that is, power-law behavior of the strength correlation function of bus stops and verify scale invariance of the strength fluctuations. Such criticality is probed by means of the scaling and renormalization analysis of the modified gravity model applied to the system. Here a group of nearby (bare) bus stops are transformed into a (renormalized) ''block stop'' and the scaling relations of the network density turn out to be closely related to the fractal dimensions of the system, revealing the underlying structure. Specifically, the resulting renormalized values of the gravity exponent and of the Hill coefficient give a good description of the Seoul bus system: The former measures the characteristic dimensionality of the network whereas the latter reflects the coupling between distinct transportation modes. It is thus demonstrated that such ideas of physics as scaling and renormalization can be applied successfully to social phenomena exemplified by the passenger flow.",2-s2.0-84897134005,1,2014,PLoS ONE,1

We examine how corporate social media affects the capital market consequences of firms' disclosure in the context of consumer product recalls. Product recalls constitute a ""product crisis"" exposing the firm to reputational damage, loss of future sales, and legal liability. During such a crisis it is crucial for the firm to quickly and directly communicate its intended message to a wide network of stakeholders, which, in turn, renders corporate social media a potentially useful channel of disclosure. While we document that corporate social media, on average, attenuates the negative price reaction to recall announcements, the attenuation benefits of corporate social media vary with the level of control the firm has over its social media content. In particular, with the arrival of Facebook and Twitter, firms relinquished complete control over their social media content, and the attenuation benefits of corporate social media, while still significant, lessened. Detailed Twitter analysis confirms that the moderating effect of social media varies with the level of firm involvement and with the amount of control exerted by other users: the negative price reaction to a recall is attenuated by the frequency of tweets by the firm, while exacerbated by the frequency of tweets by other users.",2-s2.0-84928256250,1,2015,Journal of Accounting Research,1

Then we analyze the dynamics of users' privacy protection behavior based on the proposed community structured evolutionary game theoretic framework. Results show that social network managers need to provide appropriate security service b and payment mechanism c to ensure that cost performance b/c is larger than the critical cost performance, which can promote the spread of the privacy security behavior over the network. Moreover, results can help to design appropriate structure of the social network and control the convergence speed that all users take the privacy protection.",2-s2.0-85019175319,1,2017,"2016 IEEE Global Conference on Signal and Information Processing, GlobalSIP 2016 - Proceedings",1

Recent research activities in the areas of opinion mining, sentiment analysis and emotion detection from natural language texts are gaining ground under the umbrella of affective computing. Nowadays, there is a huge amount of text data available in the Social Media (e.g. forums, blogs, and social networks) concerning to users’ opinions about experiences buying products and hiring services. Sentiment analysis or opinion mining is the field of study that analyses people’s opinions and mood from written text available on the Web. In this paper, we present extensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of the psychological and linguistic features for sentiment classification. To this purpose, we have used four psycholinguistic dimensions obtained from LIWC, and one stylometric dimension obtained from WordSmith, for the subsequent training of the SVM, Naïve Bayes, and J48 algorithms. Also, we create a corpus of tourist reviews from the travel website TripAdvisor. The findings reveal that the stylometric dimension is quite feasible for sentiment classification. Finally, with regard to the classifiers, SVM provides better results than Naïve Bayes and J48 with an F-measure rate of 90.8%.",2-s2.0-85015415864,1,2017,Intelligent Systems Reference Library,1

Background: A sizable majority of adult Internet users report looking for health information online. Social networking sites (SNS) like Facebook represent a common place to seek information, but very little is known about the representation and use of health content on SNS. Objective: Our goal in this study was to understand the role of SNS in health information seeking. More specifically, we aimed to describe how health conditions are represented on Facebook Pages and how users interact with these different conditions. Methods: We used Google Insights to identify the 20 most searched for health conditions on Google and then searched each of the resulting terms on Facebook. We compiled a list of the first 50 Facebook ""Pages"" results for each health condition. After filtering results to identify pages relevant to our research, we categorized pages into one of seven categories based on the page's primary purpose. We then measured user engagement by evaluating the number of ""Likes"" for different conditions and types of pages. Results: The search returned 50 pages for 18 of the health conditions, but only 48 pages were found for ""anemia"" and 5 pages were found for ""flu symptoms"", yielding a total of 953 pages. A large number of pages (29.4%, 280/953) were irrelevant to the health condition searched. Of the 673 relevant pages, 151 were not in English or originated outside the United States, leaving 522 pages to be coded for content. The most common type of page was marketing/promotion (32.2%, 168/522) followed by information/awareness (20.7%, 108/522), Wikipedia-type pages (15.5%, 81/522), patient support (9.4%, 49/522), and general support (3.6%, 19/522). Health conditions varied greatly by the primary page type. All health conditions had some marketing/promotion pages and this made up 76% (29/38) of pages on acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). The largest percentage of general support pages were cancer (19%, 6/32) and stomach (16%, 4/25). For patient support, stroke (67%, 4/6), lupus (33%, 10/30), breast cancer (19%, 6/31), arthritis (16%, 6/36), and diabetes (16%, 6/37) ranked the highest. Six health conditions were not represented by any type of support pages (ie, human papillomavirus, diarrhea, flu symptoms, pneumonia, spine, human immunodeficiency virus). Marketing/promotion pages accounted for 46.73% (10,371,169/22,191,633) of all Likes, followed by support pages (40.66%, 9,023,234/22,191,633). Cancer and breast cancer accounted for 86.90% (19,284,066/22,191,633) of all page Likes. Conclusions: This research represents the first attempts to comprehensively describe publicly available health content and user engagement with health conditions on Facebook pages. Public health interventions using Facebook will need to be designed to ensure relevant information is easy to find and with an understanding that stigma associated with some health conditions may limit the users' engagement with Facebook pages.

The frequency and intensity of natural disasters has significantly increased over the past decades and this trend is predicted to continue. Facing these possible and unexpected disasters, understanding and simulating of human emergency mobility following disasters will become the critical issue for planning effective humanitarian relief, disaster management, and long-term societal reconstruction. However, due to the uniqueness of various disasters and the unavailability of reliable and large scale human mobility data, such kind of research is very difficult to be performed. Hence, in this paper, we collect big and heterogeneous data (e.g. 1.6 million users' GPS records in three years, 17520 times of Japan earthquake data in four years, news reporting data, transportation network data and etc.) to capture and analyze human emergency mobility following different disasters. By mining these big data, we aim to understand what basic laws govern human mobility following disasters, and develop a general model of human emergency mobility for generating and simulating large amount of human emergency movements. The experimental results and validations demonstrate the efficiency of our simulation model, and suggest that human mobility following disasters may be significantly more predictable and can be easier simulated than previously thought.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to contribute to the mapping of the social media discourse involving politicians and their followers during election campaigns, the authors examined Israeli politicians' Aristotelian rhetoric on Facebook and its reception during the 2013 elections campaign. Design/methodology/approach: The authors examined the Aristotelian rhetorical strategies used by Israeli politicians on their Facebook walls during the 2013 elections, and their popularity with social media users. Findings: Ethos was the most prevalent rhetorical strategy used. On the reception front, pathos-based appeals attracted the most likes. Finally, the results point to some discrepancy between politicians' campaign messages and the rhetoric that actually gains social media users' attention. Research limitations/implications: The findings indicate that Israel's multi-party political system encourages emphasis on candidates' credibility (ethos) in contrast to the prevalence of emotion (pathos) in typical election campaigns in two-party systems like the USA. One possible explanation is the competitive nature of elections in a multi-party system where candidates need to emphasise their character and distinct leadership abilities. Practical implications: Politicians and campaign managers are advised to attend to the potential discrepancy between politicians' output and social media users' preferences, and to the effectiveness of logos-based appeals. Originality/value: The study highlights the possible effect of the party system on politicians' online rhetoric in social media election campaigns.",2-s2.0-84937391776,1,2015,Online Information Review,1

This chapter introduces the concept of ""two-sided"" markets and shows how they comprise a unique type of social media that facilitates the development of social networks oriented toward specific product domains (e.g., restaurants), specific brands (e.g., Starbucks), or common consumer concerns (e.g., Yelp.com). Not only do two-sided-markets constitute a unique type of Website, they can be integrated with or linked to other social media, thereby enriching the value of both the two-sided market and its partner(s). Because a two-sided market increases in value for all three parties that constitute it (consumers, the platform, and vendors) as the number of both vendors and consumer participants grows, platform managers are eager to use incentive strategies to encourage consumers to increase their active use of the site. Among these incentive strategies are various reward programs that stimulate use by rewarding consumers who add content, post reviews, comment on others' reviews, and more. Part of this chapter describes two online experiments that demonstrate that two types of common reward programs, monetary and social rewards (Heyman & Ariely, 2004), are effective in stimulating consumer intent to use the site more actively than without a reward. Finally, we make several suggestions for integrating two-sided markets into other social media, and we propose several avenues for future research into this topic that should increase our understanding of how consumers behave in two-sided markets and how platform managers can both enhance active use and use the information derived from this use.",2-s2.0-84944574504,1,2013,Organizations and Social Networking: Utilizing Social Media to Engage Consumers,1

The present paper focuses on the analysis of forest conflicts across the world, with aim of identifying tools for facilitating the analysis of these conflicts. The data on the conflicts were collected using two methods: a manually constructed conflict database covering 300 documented forest conflicts (identified from academic sources, international organisations and non-governmental organisations) and an automatically generated data-set of the frequency of associations in the Internet between the concept forest conflict and the countries names. For each country, the number of forest conflicts documented was compiled, the type of conflict categorised and the frequency of hits linking the country name to forest conflicts. The analysis performed showed that there was an important qualitative relation between the data retrieved automatically from the Internet and the cases documented manually. Additionally, it was found that the location and type of the forest conflict conditioned their quantitative presence in the Internet. In addition, there were areas with high presence in the Internet but with few references by environmental non-governmental organisations (ENGOs) and the international academic community, such as central Asia. Final maps using this data for performing indices were created and discussed.

Today, privacy is a key concept. It is also one which is rapidly evolving with technological advances, and there is no consensus on a single definition for it. In fact, the concept of privacy has been defined in many different ways, ranging from the right to be left alone to being a commodity that can be bought and sold. In the same time, powerful Ambient Intelligence (AmI) systems are being developed, that deploy context-aware, personalised, adaptive and anticipatory services. In such systems personal data is vastly collected, stored, and distributed, making privacy preservation a critical issue. The human-centred focus of AmI systems has prompted the introduction of new kinds of technologies, e.g. Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PET), and methodologies, e.g. Privacy by Design (PbD), whereby privacy concerns are included in the design of the system. One particular application field, where privacy preservation is of critical importance is Ambient Assisted Living (AAL). Emerging from the continuous increase of the ageing population, AAL focuses on intelligent systems of assistance for a better, healthier and safer life in their living environment. In this paper, we first build on our previous work, in which we introduced a new tripartite categorisation of privacy as a right, an enabler, and a commodity. Second, we highlight the specific privacy issues raised in AAL. Third, we review and discuss current approaches for privacy preservation. Finally, drawing on lessons learned from AAL, we provide insights on the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.

The basic characteristics of extreme events are their infrequence and potential damages to the human–nature system. It is difficult for people to design comprehensive policies for dealing with such events due to time pressure and their limit knowledge about rare and uncertain sequential impacts. Recently, online media provides digital source of individual and public information to study collective human responses to extreme events, which can help us reduce the damages of an extreme event and improve the efficiency of disaster relief. More specifically, there are different emotional responses (e.g., anxiety and anger) to an event and its subevents during a whole event, which can be reflected in the contents of public news and social media to a certain degree. Therefore, an online computational method for extracting these contents can help us better understand human emotional states at different stages of an event, reveal underlying reasons, and improve the efficiency of event relief. Here, we first employ tweets and reports extracted from Twitter and ReliefWeb for text analysis on three distinct events. Then, we detect textual contents by sentiment lexicon to find out human emotional responses over time. Moreover, a clustering-based method is proposed to detect emotional responses to a certain episode during events based on the co-occurrences of words as used in tweets and/or articles. Taking Japanese earthquake in 2011, Haiti earthquake in 2010 and Swine influenza A (H1N1) pandemic in 2009 as case studies, we reveal the underlying reasons of distinct patterns of human emotional responses to the whole events and their episodes.",2-s2.0-85019064444,0,2017,Applied Mathematics and Computation,1

Developments in transportation and information and communication technologies (ICTs) have facilitated the process labeled activity fragmentation. In this process, the weakened associations between activity, time, and place that ICTs made possible facilitate the disintegration of activities into smaller subtasks, which can then be performed at different times and at different locations. However, until now discussion of the fragmentation of activity hypothesis has been limited to the theoretical domain and largely absent from the empirical domain. In the study reported here we connect both domains by (1) developing a set of measures of activity fragmentation and (2) applying them to study the fragmentation of the activity of paid work using combined activity, travel, and communication diary data collected in the Netherlands in 2007 in order to assess the performance of these indicators.

We attest that the tensor-based technique is effective for temporal link prediction applied to the intermittently connected networks.

Four themes were constructed on the Twitter content: backstage performances of: a) self; b) interaction and frontstage performances of: c) Paralympic promotion; d) reporting news. Athletes used Twitter to blur the lines between backstage and frontstage performances, providing glimpses of their private time but also serving as a marketing arm for US Paralympics. The importance of understanding what athletes were tweeting during this time lies in the marketing function they performed due to the lack of US media covering the event.

In today's competitive business world, being aware of customer needs and market-oriented production is a key success factor for industries. To this aim, the use of efficient analytical algorithms ensures better understanding of customer feedback and improves the next generation of products. Accordingly, the dramatic increase in the use of social media in daily life provides beneficial sources for market analytics. Yet how traditional analytic algorithms and methods can be scaled up for such disparate and multistructured data sources is a major challenge. This paper presents and discusses the technological and scientific focus of SoMABiT as a social media analysis platform using big data technology. Sentiment analysis has been employed in order to discover knowledge from social media. The use of MapReduce and the development of a distributed algorithm towards an integrated platform that can scale for any data volume and provide social media-driven knowledge is the main novelty of the proposed concept in comparison to the state-of-the-art technologies.",2-s2.0-84948400513,1,2015,Journal of Information Science,1

Background In October 2013, we implemented 'Influmeter', a web-based influenza-like illness (ILI) self-reporting system, to monitor ILI in the general population in a timely fashion, to provide data for estimations of the burden of influenza and to gain experience with online surveillance systems, in Denmark. After the season 2013/2014 we evaluated the system to decide on its future use. Methods Influmeter study participants provided personal details upon enrolment and reported symptoms weekly within predefined categories. We compared distribution of Influmeter participants with the Danish population, by sex, age, region, chronic diseases and educational level. We calculated the proportion of participants reporting symptoms of ILI weekly and the proportion of Influmeter ILI cases seeking medical assistance, using the Danish and the EU ILI case definitions. Further, we compared timing of increased ILI rates in Influmeter with existing Danish sentinel ILI surveillance using the Danish case definition. Results Compared with the Danish population, Influmeter had more females (p<0.001) and persons with a higher education (p<0.001), while the age group 0-24 was under-represented (p<0.001). Influmeter ILI activity peaked 1 week before the exceeding of the sentinel epidemic threshold. Depending on ILI case definition 16-22% of ILI cases sought medical assistance. Conclusion Influmeter was useful in the timely monitoring of ILI activity in the population that did not seek medical assistance in relation to ILI. We recommend continuation of the system, targeted enrolment of the young and future analyses adjusted for uneven representation relative to the underlying population.",2-s2.0-84962224753,1,2016,Infectious Diseases,1

The discovery of evolving communities in dynamic networks is an important research topic that poses challenging tasks. Evolutionary clustering is a recent framework for clustering dynamic networks that introduces the concept of temporal smoothness inside the community structure detection method. Evolutionary-based clustering approaches try to maximize cluster accuracy with respect to incoming data of the current time step, and minimize clustering drift from one time step to the successive one. In order to optimize both these two competing objectives, an input parameter that controls the preference degree of a user towards either the snapshot quality or the temporal quality is needed. In this paper the detection of communities with temporal smoothness is formulated as a multiobjective problem and a method based on genetic algorithms is proposed. The main advantage of the algorithm is that it automatically provides a solution representing the best trade-off between the accuracy of the clustering obtained, and the deviation from one time step to the successive. Experiments on synthetic data sets show the very good performance of the method when compared with state-of-the-art approaches.",2-s2.0-84904623355,1,2014,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,1

Purpose: The purpose of this study is to investigate airline users' microblog postings pertaining to their travel-related information exchange so as to assess their wants, preferences and feedback about airline products and services. Examining such real-time information exchange is important as users rely on this for various purposes such as seeking help and evaluating the airline services before purchasing. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses Twitter, a popular microblog service. An analysis of 8,978 postings that mention three specific airlines - i.e. Malaysia Airlines, Jet Blue and Southwest - as well as 260 airline postings on their official Twitter accounts is undertaken. The types of postings were ascertained via content analysis. Additionally, the postings were also analyzed to uncover types of communication exchanges between airlines and their users. Findings: The findings suggest that microblogs were primarily used to share compliments, while airlines used microblogs mainly for marketing. Other uses such as sharing general information, asking questions and providing personal updates were also uncovered. Additionally, a high number of attention-seeking postings were found that highlighted user issues and concerns. Further, the airlines being studied did not appear to be as responsive to users' postings as expected. Originality/value: The findings broaden the understanding of what users frequently discuss on microblogs when they communicate about airlines. Next, this study indicates that users adopt microblogs to offer recommendations and share their concerns so that their communication can reach airlines in near real-time. Moreover, this study also suggests that airlines could incorporate this medium for customer relationship management to better meet the needs of their customers.",2-s2.0-84863021900,1,2012,Program,1

Digital wireless radios broadcast identification numbers that uniquely identify them. As has been previously observed, given the ubiquity with which people carry smartphones with their embedded WiFi radios powered on, comes the ability to track individuals' movements. The ability to use wireless radios for positioning has been previously observed and developed in to useful products. In these systems a user willingly geolocates themselves by providing identifiers to infrastructure hardware. In this paper we consider the converse question: what rates of monitoring by smartphones devices in a given metropolitan area are necessary to achieve different levels of involuntary geolocation. While previous work has looked at countermeasure that attempt to maintain privacy, no work has attempted to quantify the problem and risks. Using appropriate simulations we give the first quantitative support for the number and conditions of tracking devices necessary to track the locations of non-participant individuals in urban environments. We provide evidence that a small, but not insignificant, number of mobile devices can be used to track a majority of users during a significant fraction of their travel with current devices. We conclude that in the immediate future, malnets would require relatively high infection rates to pose a significant threat, but that voluntary networks, with perceived benefit can probably achieve the usage rates necessary to track individual movements of non-subscribed users to a high-degree of accuracy. Our results also suggest ubiquitous deployment of 802.11n in smartphones would make geolocation feasible by malnets.

Traditional public health surveillance methods such as those employed by the CDC (United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) rely on regular clinical reports, which are almost always manual and labor intensive. Twitter, a popular micro-blogging service, provides the possibility of automated public health surveillance. Tweets, however, are less than 140 characters, and do not provide sufficient word occurrences for conventional classification methods to work reliably. Moreover, natural language is complex. This makes health-related classification more challenging. In this study, we use flu-related classification as a demonstration to propose a hybrid classification method, which combines two classification approaches: manually- defined features and auto-generated features by machine learning approaches. Preprocessing based on Natural Language Processing (NLP) is used to help extract useful information, and to eliminate noise features.

This begins with the establishment of ground truth keywords followed by word-level and category-level empirical keywords. Next, semantic categories of humor, emotion and negation are considered. Following, a classifier is applied for additional filtering to further support the characterization of consumer behavior. We apply this procedure to the goal of modeling vehicle purchase behavior with data acquired from Twitter.

The particular problem of interest is the effective mining of long sequences from large-scale location data to be practical for Reality Mining applications, which suffer from large amounts of noise and lack of ground truth. To address this complex data, we propose an unsupervised probabilistic topic model called the distant n-gram topic model (DNTM). The DNTM is based on latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), which is extended to integrate sequential information. We define the generative process for the model, derive the inference procedure, and evaluate our model on both synthetic data and real mobile phone data. We consider two different mobile phone datasets containing natural human mobility patterns obtained by location sensing, the first considering GPS/wi-fi locations and the second considering cell tower connections. The DNTM discovers meaningful topics on the synthetic data as well as the two mobile phone datasets. Finally, the DNTM is compared to LDA by considering log-likelihood performance on unseen data, showing the predictive power of the model.

Research concerned with a decline of associational involvement has examined whether the use of social networking sites, such as Facebook, may reinvigorate or crowd out involvement in civil society. Yet, previous studies have not systematically investigated possible effects of Facebook use on associational membership. We posit that the effects of Facebook use are twofold: Facebook stimulates associational membership directly through its inherent networking features and indirectly by compensating for the lack of traditional mobilizing factors, such as social trust and internal efficacy. Relying on a probabilistic sample of German participants aged 18–49, our findings show that Facebook users are more likely to be members of voluntary associations and that Facebook use increases the likelihood of associational membership even for individuals with low levels of social trust and internal efficacy. Instead of crowding out offline associational involvement, Facebook use stimulates membership in voluntary associations, thus contributing to the vitality of civil society.",2-s2.0-84975485737,1,2016,Journal of Information Technology and Politics,1

We study the issue of polarization in society through a model of opinion formation. We say an opinion formation process is polarizing if it results in increased divergence of opinions. Empirical studies have shown that homophily, i.e., greater interaction between like-minded individuals, results in polarization. However, we show that DeGroot's well-known model of opinion formation based on repeated averaging can never be polarizing, even if individuals are arbitrarily homophilous. We generalize DeGroot's model to account for a phenomenon well known in social psychology as biased assimilation: When presented with mixed or inconclusive evidence on a complex issue, individuals draw undue support for their initial position, thereby arriving at a more extreme opinion. We show that in a simple model of homophilous networks, our biased opinion formation process results in polarization if individuals are sufficiently biased. In other words, homophily alone, without biased assimilation, is not sufficient to polarize society. Quite interestingly, biased assimilation also provides a framework to analyze the polarizing effect of Internet-based recommender systems that show us personalized content.",2-s2.0-84876046902,0,2013,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,1

Background: The objective of this study was to investigate the use of novel surveillance tools in a malaria endemic region where prevalence information is limited. Specifically, online reporting for participatory epidemiology was used to gather information about malaria spread directly from the public. Individuals in India were incentivized to self-report their recent experience with malaria by micro-monetary payments. Methods. Self-reports about malaria diagnosis status and related information were solicited online via Amazon's Mechanical Turk. Responders were paid $0.02 to answer survey questions regarding their recent experience with malaria. Timing of the peak volume of weekly self-reported malaria diagnosis in 2010 was compared to other available metrics such as the volume over time of and information about the epidemic from media sources. Distribution of Plasmodium species reports were compared with values from the literature. The study was conducted in summer 2010 during a malaria outbreak in Mumbai and expanded to other cities during summer 2011, and prevalence from self-reports in 2010 and 2011 was contrasted. Results: Distribution of Plasmodium species diagnosis through self-report in 2010 revealed 59% for Plasmodium vivax, which is comparable to literature reports of the burden of P. vivax in India (between 50 and 69%). Self-reported Plasmodium falciparum diagnosis was 19% and during the 2010 outbreak and the estimated burden was between 10 and 15%. Prevalence between 2010 and 2011 via self-reports decreased significantly from 36.9% to 19.54% in Mumbai (p = 0.001), and official reports also confirmed a prevalence decrease in 2011. Conclusions: With careful study design, micro-monetary incentives and online reporting are a rapid way to solicit malaria, and potentially other public health information. This methodology provides a cost-effective way of executing a field study that can act as a complement to traditional public health surveillance methods, offering an opportunity to obtain information about malaria activity, temporal progression, demographics affected or Plasmodium-specific diagnosis at a finer resolution than official reports can provide.

966,23623,Sasahara K.,Visualizing collective attention using association networks,"Visualizing collective attention using association networks. The socialization of the Web changes the ways we behave both online and offline, leading to a novel emergent phenomenon called “collective attention” in which people’s attention is suddenly concentrated on a particular real- life event. Visualizing collective attention is fundamental to understand human behavior in the digital age. Here we propose “association networks” to visualize usage-based, term-association patterns in a large dataset of tweets (short text messages) during collective attention events. First, we train the word2vec model to obtain vector representations of terms (words) based on semantic similarities, and then construct association networks: given some terms as seeds, the associated terms are linked with each other using the trained word2vec model, and considering the resulting terms as new seeds, the same procedure is repeated. Using two sets of Twitter data—the 2011 Japan earthquake and the 2011 FIFA Women’s World Cup—we demonstrate how association networks visualize collective attention on these events. Provided the Japan earthquake dataset, the association networks that emerged from the most frequently used terms, such as earthquake and tsunami, exhibit distinct network structure related to people’s attention during the earthquake, whereas one that emerged from emotion-related terms, such as great and terrible, shows a large connected cluster of negative terms and small clusters of positive terms. Furthermore, we compare association networks in different datasets, using the same seed terms. These results indicate the proposed method to be a useful tool for visualizing the implicit nature of collective attention that is otherwise invisible.",2-s2.0-84982204076,1,2015,Transactions of the Japanese Society for Artificial Intelligence,1

Official government-led case count data in Latin America are typically delayed by several weeks, making it difficult to track the disease in a timely manner.

Methodology/Principal Findings: We combined information from Zika-related Google searches, Twitter microblogs, and the HealthMap digital surveillance system with historical Zika suspected case counts to track and predict estimates of suspected weekly Zika cases during the 2015–2016 Latin American outbreak, up to three weeks ahead of the publication of official case data. We evaluated the predictive power of these data and used a dynamic multivariable approach to retrospectively produce predictions of weekly suspected cases for five countries: Colombia, El Salvador, Honduras, Venezuela, and Martinique. Models that combined Google (and Twitter data where available) with autoregressive information showed the best out-of-sample predictive accuracy for 1-week ahead predictions, whereas models that used only Google and Twitter typically performed best for 2- and 3-week ahead predictions.

As one way of taking advantage of the relative merits of different algorithms, we gave users the ability to change the algorithm providing their movie recommendations and studied how they make use of this power. We conducted our study with the launch of a new version of the MovieLens movie recommender that supports multiple recommender algorithms and allows users to choose the algorithm they want to provide their recommendations. We examine log data from user interactions with this new feature to understand whether and how users switch among recommender algorithms, and select a final algorithm to use. We also look at the properties of the algorithms as they were experienced by users and examine their relationships to user behavior. We found that a substantial portion of our user base (25%) used the recommender-switching feature. The majority of users who used the control only switched algorithms a few times, trying a few out and settling down on an algorithm that they would leave alone. The largest number of users prefer a matrix factorization algorithm, followed closely by item-item collaborative filtering; users selected both of these algorithms much more often than they chose a non-personalized mean recommender.

Social influence occurs when one's opinions, emotions, or behaviors are affected by others, intentionally or unintentionally. In this article, we survey recent research progress on social influence analysis. In particular, we first give a brief overview of related background knowledge, and then discuss what is social influence. We try to answer this question in terms of homophily and the process of influence and selection. After that, we focus on describing computational models for social influence including models for influence probability learning and influence diffusion. Finally, we discuss potential applications of social influence. Preliminaries First we introduce some basic knowledge for social network analysis, including related theories in sociology, fundamental models underlying social networks, and algorithms or measures for quantifying social influence. For social theories, we introduce social balance theory [10], social status theory [21], structural hole theory [6, 22], and two-step information flow theory [19]. For social network models, we introduce the Erdös-Rényi (ER) model [11], Small-Worldmodel [28], and the Barabási-Albert (BA) model [4]. For algorithms, we review several fundamental problems in graph theory and the corresponding algorithms to solve them including the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm for maximum flow in a flow network [12], the push-relabel maximum flow algorithm for finding k-densest subgraph [13], and the greedy algorithm for the set covering problem [1]. We will also go through standard measures and concepts of social networks and their connection to social influence such as centrality, clustering coefficient, closeness and betweenness. These measures are fundamental concepts about social network analysis, and are also deeply related to the importance or influence of nodes or edges in the networks. Definition and Existential Test As there is no a formal definition for social influence, we discuss its definition in terms of several related concepts such as homophily [20], conformity [8, 27], and selection. We further describe methodologies for verifying the existence of influence in various social networks. The methods include shuffle test [2] and randomization test [24]. We will give real world examples to demonstrate how the social influence behaves in different social networks. For example, Bond et al. [5] conducted a randomized controlled trial by delivering political mobilization messages to 61 million Facebook users. Their results verified the existence of social influence on political voting behavior - when one is aware that their friends have made the political votes, their likelihood to vote will significantly increase. Bakshy et al. [3] also conducted randomized controlled trials to verify the existence of social influence on customer responses to advertising in Facebook. Computational Models We now focus on describing the computational models for social influence analysis, with an emphasis on influence quantification and influence diffusion. In particular, for influence quantification, we introduce several popular methods for learning the influence probability between users. For example, Tang et al. [26] presented a Topical Affinity Propagation (TAP) approach to quantify the topic-level social influence in large networks. Goyal et al. [14] presented a method to learn the influence probabilities by counting the number of correlated social actions. Tan et a. [25] proposed a model to learn and distinguish the effects of influence, correlation, and uses' action dependency. Kutzkov et al. [18] extended influence probability learning to the stream data. They showed that the influence probabilities could be learned with one pass over the streaming data using only O(n log n) space, where n is the number of nodes in a network. For influence diffusion, we start with several state-of-the-art epidemic models such as Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) [17], Susceptible-Infectious-Susceptible (SIS), and Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered-Susceptible (SIRS). Then, we focus on the two popular influence maximization model including independent cascaded model and linear threshold model. The problem of influence maximization has been formally defined as an algorithmic problem by Domingos and Richardson [9, 23]. Kempe et al. [16] further presented the independent cascaded model and the linear threshold model, and theoretically proved the NP-hardness of the two models. They defined the problem using submodular functions, with which a natural greedy strategy could obtain a solution that is provably within (1 - 1/e) of optimal solution. Chen et al. [7] further developed efficient algorithms to 205 approximately solve the influence maximization problem. Finally we will also discuss several extensions of the basic cascaded and linear threshold models, e.g., [15, 30, 29]. Applications Finally we use several real applications as examples to further demonstrate the usefulness of social influence analysis. We empirically study social influence in more than 10 datasets including Twitter, Weibo, Flickr, Gowalla, Coauthor, Mobile, Slashdot, Enron, Epinions, etc. We will share our experience and interesting findings when studying social influence on these data.",2-s2.0-84990945085,0,2014,WWW 2014 Companion - Proceedings of the 23rd International Conference on World Wide Web,1

This paper brings a sociological perspective to an area dominated by social psychology, that of persuasion. It discusses how networks can be used to describe context for persuasive messages. It has been previously argued that network awareness, having knowledge of how networks affect behavior and perception, combined with knowledge of the networks in some part of society such as an organization or region, is important for innovation and productivity. This paper expands on this by introducing the concept of ""social context."" While the idea of location in social structure is not new, the difference here is that this paper talks not just about abstract location in social space, but the more concrete realization of it in communication networks based on cell phones, social networking software, IM, email and other new technology is. I argue that the ability to observe and measure these networks can give insight into the user's behavior, attitudes and worldview and provide a context for persuasion to take place.",2-s2.0-70349967933,1,2008,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),1

Users' home location is important information for many advanced information services in big data applications (e.g., localized recommendation, target ads of local business and urban planning). In this paper, we study the problem of accurately inferring the home locations of people from the noisy and sparse data they voluntarily share on online social media. Previous studies have developed supervised learning approaches to predict a person's home location in a city. However, the accuracy of these techniques largely depends on a high quality training dataset, which is difficult and expensive to obtain in practice. In this study, we propose a new analytical framework, Unsupervised Home Location Inference (UHLI), to accurately infer the home locations of people using a set of principle approaches. In particular, the UHLI scheme addresses the critical challenges of using sparse and noisy online social media data and derives an optimal solution to the home location inference problem. We evaluated the performance of our scheme and compared it to the state-of-the-art baselines using three real world data traces collected from Foursquare. The results showed that our scheme can accurately infer the home location of people and significantly outperform the state-of-the-art baselines.",2-s2.0-85015254573,1,2016,"Proceedings - 2016 IEEE International Conference on Big Data, Big Data 2016",1
978,10678,Canals-Cerdá J.J.,Nonlinear pricing in e-commerce,"Nonlinear pricing in e-commerce. Internet markets are usually under the command of a market intermediary that charges fees for its services. Differences in quality across items being sold allow the market intermediary to employ lucrative nonlinear pricing strategies and to offer different levels of service. For several years now, eBay has been using a nonlinear pricing policy that offers sellers the opportunity of having their items listed first when buyers search for specific products in return for an additional fee. A similar pricing strategy is also used in other online markets like Overstock.com and ArtByUs.com, and is also employed by search engines when sponsored links are displayed first. In this paper we analyze this topic from a theoretical and empirical perspective. Intuitively, potential buyers are more likely to examine items listed first and sellers of high quality items are more likely to pay an extra fee in order to have preferential access to buyers. In the theoretical section of the paper we analyze the optimal pricing policy of the market intermediary in a market with heterogeneous goods. In the empirical sections of the paper we analyze a unique panel of approximately 2,200 art auctions from artists who sell their own work through eBay. We use our data to quantify the overall impact of this pricing policy on the revenues of the sellers and the market intermediary. As expected, this pricing policy creates a selection effect by which sellers of the most valuable paintings are willing to pay an extra fee in order to gain access to a large pool of potential buyers. Our results also indicate that the pricing policy implemented by eBay increases revenues significantly for sellers and for the market intermediary when compared with a single-price policy and acts as a coordination mechanism that facilitates the match between buyers and sellers.",2-s2.0-84901554435,1,2008,Contemporary Research in E-Branding,1

CAPTCHA stands for ""Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart"" and has received much attention since it first began appearing on websites. It requires the deciphering of distorted texts, mostly in English which is something that computers still cannot do well. It is also helpful in preventing the abuse of online services. The current text-based CAPTCHA requires users to be able to read English characters. For Thai Internet users who might not be very familiar with English, a Thai language based CAPTCHA may be a more appropriate option. To date, no published work has examined the extent to which Thai Internet users are familiar with CAPTCHA; therefore, this study attempts to survey their awareness of, and attitudes towards, the online test. Based on 340 usable online questionnaire submissions, it was found that Thai Internet users are generally aware of CAPTCHA, but their understanding of it does not go very deep. Using exploratory factor analysis, their attitudes towards CAPTCHA can be classified in two dimensions: (1) the perceived drawbacks of the CAPTCHA test and (2) the feasibility of Thai language CAPTCHA. In addition to providing our insights into the application of CAPTCHA in the Thai Internet user context, online service providers could take certain measures to improve users' attitudes and understanding regarding CATPCHA.

Technology is rapidly evolving, and with it comes increasingly sophisticated bots (i.e. software robots) which automatically produce content to inform, influence, and deceive genuine users. This is particularly a problem for social media networks where content tends to be extremely short, informally written, and full of inconsistencies. Motivated by the rise of bots on these networks, we investigate the ease with which a bot can deceive a human. In particular, we focus on deceiving a human into believing that an automatically generated sample of text was written by a human, as well as analysing which factors affect how convincing the text is. To accomplish this, we train a set of models to write text about several distinct topics, to simulate a bot's behaviour, which are then evaluated by a panel of judges. We find that: (1) typical Internet users are twice as likely to be deceived by automated content than security researchers; (2) text that disagrees with the crowd's opinion is more believably human; (3) light-hearted topics such as Entertainment are significantly easier to deceive with than factual topics such as Science; and (4) automated text on Adult content is the most deceptive regardless of a user's background.",2-s2.0-84975842583,1,2016,Proceedings of the ACM Symposium on Applied Computing,1
984,3245,Park J.-H.,Differences among university students and faculties in social networking site perception and use Implications for academic library services,"Differences among university students and faculties in social networking site perception and use Implications for academic library services. Purpose - Social networking sites (SNSs) are gaining popularity in various areas. Library and information services also are attempting to utilize them for increasing the library user traffic. Considering the lack of SNS studies in academic library services and various SNS usage patterns according to user type, it is necessary to compare the usage patterns across different user groups. This paper thus aims to explore the usages of a SNS by different university users. Design/methodology/approach - Data were collected through semi-structured and open-ended interviews conducted with undergraduates, graduates, and faculty members at Yonsei University in Seoul, South Korea. Data were analyzed according to the three groups (undergraduates, graduates, and faculty members) and within each group SNS user perception and use were examined across the three different user activity groups (active users, semi-active users, and non-active users). Findings - The analyses indicated that the three groups of users demonstrated distinct patterns of SNS use. Although undergraduates used the profile service more than the community service, graduates used the community more than the profile service. Most faculty members were not active users. Six factors that affected these different usage patterns were identified: desire for expression, peer influences, familiarity with information technologies, sensitivity to privacy, nature of using the internet, and perception of the SNS. Practical implications - A differentiated approach is necessary for SNS-based academic library services. Originality/value - The paper makes useful and initial suggestions for implementing SNS-based library and information service in academic settings.",2-s2.0-77953247035,0,2010,Electronic Library,1

First, we perform a high frequency scrape of 36 pages of search results and analyze it by looking at the rate of disappearance of tasks across key ways Mechanical Turk allows workers to sort tasks. Second, we present the results of a survey in which we paid workers for self-reported information about how they search for tasks. Our main findings are that on a large scale, workers sort by which tasks are most recently posted and which have the largest number of tasks available. Furthermore, we find that workers look mostly at the first page of the most recently posted tasks and the first two pages of the tasks with the most available instances but in both categories the position on the result page is unimportant to workers. We observe that at least some employers try to manipulate the position of their task in the search results to exploit the tendency to search for recently posted tasks. On an individual level, we observed workers searching by almost all the possible categories and looking more than 10 pages deep.

Findings shed new insights into student perspectives on and uses of social media, and the variety of ways in which undergraduates intentionally choose (or, choose not) to incorporate social media into their university learning in meaningful ways. Student perceptions formed an overarching theme of social media as a double-edged sword that both informs and distracts, having the potential to both help and hinder learning. Together, the interviews and the open-ended survey results demonstrate that several contextual relationships exist, underscoring the importance of considering affordances of social media for learning. Rather than taking an approach founded upon technological determinism, learning context and social media affordances become key.

The existing approaches for trajectory prediction (TP) are primarily concerned with discovering frequent trajectory patterns (FTPs) from historical movement data. Moreover, most of these approaches work by using a linear TP model to depict the positions of objects, which does not lend itself to the complexities of most real-world applications. In this research, we propose a three-in-one TP model in road-constrained transportation networks called TraPlan. TraPlan contains three essential techniques: 1) constrained network R-tree (CNR-tree), which is a two-tiered dynamic index structure of moving objects based on transportation networks; 2) a region-of-interest (RoI) discovery algorithm is employed to partition a large number of trajectory points into distinct clusters; and 3) a FTP-tree-based TP approach, called FTP-mining, is proposed to discover FTPs to infer future locations of objects moving within RoIs. In order to evaluate the results of the proposed CNR-tree index structure, we conducted experiments on synthetically generated data sets taken from real-world transportation networks. The results show that the CNR-tree can reduce the time cost of index maintenance by an average gap of about 40% when compared with the traditional NDTR-tree, as well as reduce the time cost of trajectory queries. Moreover, compared with fixed network R-Tree (FNR-trees), the accuracy of range queries has shown an on average improvement of about 32%. Furthermore, the experimental results show that the TraPlan demonstrates accurate and efficient prediction of possible motion curves of objects in distinct trajectory data sets by over 80% on average. Finally, we evaluate these results and the performance of the TraPlan model in regard to TP by comparing it with other TP algorithms.",2-s2.0-84930938438,1,2015,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,1

Activity-based social networks, where people upload and share information about their location-based activities (e.g., the routes of their activities), are increasingly popular. Such systems, however, raise privacy and security issues: The service providers know the exact locations of their users; the users can report fake location information in order to, for example, unduly brag about their performance. In this paper, we propose a secure privacy-preserving system for reporting location-based activity summaries (e.g., the total distance covered and the elevation gain). Our solution is based on a combination of cryptographic techniques and geometric algorithms, and it relies on existing Wi-Fi access-point networks deployed in urban areas. We evaluate our solution by using real data sets from the FON community networks and from the Garmin Connect activity-based social network, and we show that it can achieve tight (up to a median accuracy of 76%) verifiable lower-bounds of the distance covered and of the elevation gain, while protecting the location privacy of the users with respect to both the social network operator and the access-point network operator(s).

Nutrition is a key factor in people's overall health. Hence, understanding the nature and dynamics of population-wide dietary preferences over time and space can be valuable in public health. To date, studies have leveraged small samples of participants via food intake logs or treatment data. We propose a complementary source of population data on nutrition obtained via Web logs. Our main contribution is a spatiotemporal analysis of population-wide dietary preferences through the lens of logs gathered by a widely distributed Web-browser add-on, using the access volume of recipes that users seek via search as a proxy for actual food consumption. We discover that variation in dietary preferences as expressed via recipe access has two main periodic components, one yearly and the other weekly, and that there exist characteristic regional differences in terms of diet within the United States. In a second study, we identify users who show evidence of having made an acute decision to lose weight. We characterize the shifts in interests that they express in their search queries and focus on changes in their recipe queries in particular. Last, we correlate nutritional time series obtained from recipe queries with time-aligned data on hospital admissions, aimed at understanding how behavioral data captured in Web logs might be harnessed to identify potential relationships between diet and acute health problems.

The goal of this article is to place the role that social media plays in collective action within a more general theoretical structure, using the events of the Arab Spring as a case study. The article presents two broad theoretical principles. The first is that one cannot understand the role of social media in collective action without first taking into account the political environment in which they operate. The second principle states that a significant increase in the use of the new media is much more likely to follow a significant amount of protest activity than to precede it. The study examines these two principles using political, media, and protest data from twenty Arab countries and the Palestinian Authority. The findings provide strong support for the validity of the claims.",2-s2.0-84874762827,1,2013,International Journal of Press/Politics,1

Ever since the successful presidential campaign of Barack Obama in 2008, attention has been drawn to the political impact of social media. However, it remains to be seen whether the successful Obama campaign is the exception or the rule. Our research focuses specifically on the impact of social media on preference voting. First it seeks to establish whether candidates make use of social media during election campaigns and whether voters in turn follow politicians. Afterwards it examines to what extent social media make a difference and yield a preference vote bonus. Theoretically, two types of effects are outlined, namely a direct effect of the number of followers a candidate has and a statistical interaction effect whereby a higher number of followers only yields more votes when the candidate actively uses the social media. To carry out our analysis, we make use of a unique dataset that combines data on social media usage and data on the candidates themselves (such as position on the list, being wellknown, exposure to the old media, gender, ethnicity and incumbency). The dataset includes information on all 493 candidates of the 10 parties that received at least one seat in the Dutch 2010 election. It turns out that candidates are eager to use social media, but that relatively few people follow candidates. There is a significant interaction effect of social media usage and the number of followers, but that effect appears to be relatively small.",2-s2.0-84894290028,1,2014,Political Behavior,1

Areas with the biggest increases in information variety and volume include: customer information, operations, and sales/marketing. From an industry perspective, the largest opportunity for leveraging data relates to sentiment analysis and brand reputation. With the advent of social media, opportunities to monitor sentiment have become abundant. Tracking sentiment is important as brand reputation is one of the key drivers of customer acquisition and retention. Our research aims to provide a framework for analyzing social sentiment of insurance consumers with appropriate machine learning approaches for business decision support.

When the public outcry concerning the ‘Facebook experiment’ began, many commentators drew parallels to controversial social science experiments from a prior era. The infamous Milgram (1963) and Zimbardo (1973) experiments concerning the social psychology of obedience and aggression seemed in some ways obvious analogs to the Facebook experiment, at least inasmuch as all three violated norms about the treatment of human subjects in research. But besides that, what do they really have in common? In fact, a close reading of Milgram, Zimbardo, and the Facebook experiment reveals something about the way power—both as a subject of scholarly inquiry and as an element wielded by researchers—is conceptualized today. Although all three experiments were, in essence, measuring the researchers’ ability to induce an emotional or behavioral change in subjects, the Facebook experiment did much more than the others to hide such considerations and naturalize the exercise of power at work in that study. This paper thus argues that the invisibility of power in the discourse of the Facebook experiment demonstrates, in miniature, the more insidious elements of big data as a whole.",2-s2.0-84962588950,1,2016,Research Ethics,1

Micro-blogging services and location-based social networks, such as Twitter, Weibo, and Foursquare, enable users to post short messages with timestamps and geographical annotations. The rich spatial-temporalsemantic information of individuals embedded in these geo-annotated short messages provides exciting opportunity to develop many context-aware applications in ubiquitous computing environments. Example applications include contextual recommendation and contextual search. To obtain accurate recommendations and most relevant search results, it is important to capture users' contextual information (e.g., time and location) and to understand users' topical interests and intentions. While time and location can be readily captured by smartphones, understanding user's interests and intentions calls for effective methods in modeling user mobility behavior. Here, user mobility refers to who visits which place at what time for what activity. That is, user mobility behavior modeling must consider user (Who), spatial (Where), temporal (When), and activity (What) aspects. Unfortunately, no previous studies on user mobility behavior modeling have considered all of the four aspects jointly, which have complex interdependencies. In our preliminary study, we propose the first solution named W4 (short for Who, Where, When, and What) to discover user mobility behavior from the four aspects. In this article, we further enhance W4 and propose a nonparametric Bayesian model named EW4 (short for Enhanced W4 ). EW4 requires no parameter tuning and achieves better results over W4 in our experiments. Given some of the four aspects of a user (e.g., time), our model is able to infer information of the other aspects (e.g., location and topical words). Thus, our model has a variety of context-aware applications, particularly in contextual search and recommendation. Experimental results on two real-world datasets show that the proposed model is effective in discovering users' spatial-temporal topics. The model also significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines for various tasks including location prediction for tweets and requirement-aware location recommendation.",2-s2.0-84923814459,1,2015,ACM Transactions on Information Systems,1

Microblog services have emerged as an essential way to strengthen the communications among individuals and organizations. These services promote timely and active discussions and comments towards products, markets as well as public events, and have attracted a lot of attentions from organizations. In particular, emerging topics are of immediate concerns to organizations since they signal current concerns of, and feedback by their users. Two challenges must be tackled for effective emerging topic detection. One is the problem of real-time relevant data collection and the other is the ability to model the emerging characteristics of detected topics and identify them before they become hot topics. To tackle these challenges, we first design a novel scheme to crawl the relevant messages related to the designated organization by monitoring multi-aspects of microblog content, including users, the evolving keywords and their temporal sequence. We then develop an incremental clustering framework to detect new topics, and employ a range of content and temporal features to help in promptly detecting hot emerging topics. Extensive evaluations on a representative real-world dataset based on Twitter data demonstrate that our scheme is able to characterize emerging topics well and detect them before they become hot topics.

Research Design: Worldwide internet search trend data over a period of 532 weeks (4 January 2004 and 15 March 2014) retrieved from the Google Trends web site was interrogated for each search term to identify search trends, regional interests, and related searches. Results: The search volumes for the terms “toothache “and “wisdom teeth” increased over the decade while “tooth decay”, “gum disease”, and “oral cancer” showed slight changes. Each term was most commonly searched in different counties: “toothache”, Philippines; “tooth decay”, Singapore; “Gum Disease”, Ireland; “Wisdom Teeth”, United States; and “Oral cancer”, India. Related searches were mainly focused on symptoms and remedies of these problems. Conclusions: Regional and time-related variations in search volumes may provide dental professionals with readily- and freely-available pertinent information on populations’ internet searches regarding dental complaints.",2-s2.0-84906971717,0,2014,Community Dental Health,1

As violent extremists continue to surface in online discussion forums, counter-extremism agencies search for new and innovative ways of uncovering their digital indicators. Using a sample of approximately 1 million posts and 26,000 unique users across four Islamic-based discussion forums, this study proposed a method of identifying the most radical users on the Dark Web. Several characteristics of each user's postings were analyzed using Parts of Speech (POS) tagging, a custom openNLP based tagger, sentiment analysis, and a novel algorithm called «Sentiment-based Identification of Radical Authors» (SIRA). POS tagging was used to develop a list of the 400 most frequently cited nouns across the discussion forums. With this list, sentiment analysis provided the context surrounding users' posts, and each post was assigned a polarity value. Radical scores were calculated using SIRA, which is an algorithm that accounts for a user's percentile score for average sentiment score, volume of negative posts, severity of negative posts, and duration of negative posts. Results did not suggest that a simple typology or typologies best described the most radical users in the Dark Web, however, the findings indicated that SIRA was flexible enough to evaluate several combinations of online activity that could identify the most radical users in the discussion forums. In addition, SIRA identified the same user across two separate discussion forums as the most radical, thus providing validation for the algorithm. This particular user was linked to an extremist website that supported terrorists. Lastly, the results revealed that the Gawaher and Islamic Awakening web forums hosted the highest volume of most radical users in the sample.",2-s2.0-84964701721,1,2016,"Proceedings - 15th IEEE International Conference on Data Mining Workshop, ICDMW 2015",1

Design/methodology/approach: This research is based on digital camera sales data collected from amazon.com and two studies are included in this research. The first study is based on a static model and sample data from one time stamp. The second study is based on two sample data collected from two different time stamps, and a dynamic model is proposed. Findings: The results from the first study reveal that the average online customer review, the number of online reviews, the price and the camera's physical properties such as the number of pixels and the optimal zoom number (but not LCD screen size) have significant influence on digital camera sales. The results from the second study show that the sales from the previous period are an important indicator for future sales. In addition, change in price, change in average online review rating and change in the total number of online reviews are all significantly associated with future sales. Research limitations/implications: The research reveals that there is a significant relationship between the online user review and sales of search goods, and the influence of online user reviews on search goods sales is different from that on experience goods. It also recognizes that the product specifications influence the sales of search goods. In addition, the research on search goods shows that price at the specific time and price changes are significant factors affecting sales.

When you share content in an online social network, who is listening? Users have scarce information about who actually sees their content, making their audience seem invisible and difficult to estimate. However, understanding this invisible audience can impact both science and design, since perceived audiences influence content production and self-presentation online. In this paper, we combine survey and large-scale log data to examine how well users' perceptions of their audience match their actual audience on Facebook. We find that social media users consistently underestimate their audience size for their posts, guessing that their audience is just 27% of its true size. Qualitative coding of survey responses reveals folk theories that attempt to reverse-engineer audience size using feedback and friend count, though none of these approaches are particularly accurate. We analyze audience logs for 222,000 Facebook users' posts over the course of one month and find that publicly visible signals - friend count, likes, and comments - vary widely and do not strongly indicate the audience of a single post. Despite the variation, users typically reach 61% of their friends each month. Together, our results begin to reveal the invisible undercurrents of audience attention and behavior in online social networks.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to identify demographic differences based on how users interact with web applications. The research is needed to develop future systems able to adapt the representation of online information to the user's specific needs and preferences improving its usability. The following question guides this quest: is there a direct relationship between age and/or gender and interaction? Design/methodology/approach - GOMS (goals, operators, methods, and selection rules) analysis was used to reduce complex interaction tasks into basic operators like pointing, dragging, typing, etc. An experiment was designed to analyse the user performance in the use of these operators through five complex tasks: point-and-click, drag-and-drop, text selection, text edition and menu selection. The sample comprises 592 individuals which took part in the experiment. The performance was analysed using multivariate regression analysis. User laterality and the the user experience were used as control variables. Findings - The factors studied are significant enough to support user classification. The analysis evidenced that men performed significantly better than women when executing interaction pointing and dragging GOMS's operators, but no significant differences arose with regard to the performance in the typing operators. Older users performed worse in all the interaction tasks. No significant performance differences were detected between left and right-handed users. Research limitations/implications - The study pretends to lay the ground for developing artificial intelligence-based classification systems (e.g. neural networks, decision trees, etc.) able to detect significant differences in user performance, classifying users according to their age, gender and laterality. Practical implications - This user profiling would drive the organisation, selection and representation of the online information according to the specific preferences and needs of each user. This would allow the design of new personalisation algorithms able to perform dynamic adaptation of user interfaces in order to improve the usability of online information systems. Originality/value - This work extends previous research on user performance under a new approach and improved accuracy. First, it relies on the combined and simultaneous analysis of ageing and gender and the use of user laterality and experience as control variables. Second, the use of the GOMS analysis allowed the design of tests that closely resemble the user interaction in online information systems.

Social networks represent an emerging challenging sector where the natural language expressions of people can be easily reported through short but meaningful text messages. Key information that can be grasped from social environments relates to the polarity of text messages (ie, positive, negative, or neutral). In this chapter we present a literature review regarding polarity classification in social networks, by distinguishing between supervised, unsupervised, and semisupervised machine learning models. In particular, the most recent advancements of the state of the art are presented, focusing on the real nature of the messages that are actually provided in an informal and networked environment.",2-s2.0-85023598924,0,2016,Sentiment Analysis in Social Networks,1

This paper presents a novel application of sentiment analysis to recommender systems relying on explicit one-class user feedback (favorites or likes), namely joint models of unary feedback and sentiment of free-form user comments. This combination is achieved through a mapping function within a sentiment-aware nearest neighbor model (SANN), which serves as an effective personalized ranker of items according to their hypothesized relevance to users. The mapping function can be adapted to specific datasets through a machine learning algorithm. We evaluate the proposed models and compare them with state-of-the-art multimedia recommendation methods, by casting the recommendation task as a top-N retrieval task over three real-world datasets: TED lectures, Vimeo videos and Flickr images. The experimental results show that the proposed models outperform all other alternatives in a majority of cases, thus demonstrating the generality of the approach. In particular, the superiority of the adaptive sentiment-aware models validates our hypothesis that there are inherent relationships between sentiments expressed in comments and unary feedback, both at community and individual levels. The improvements due to our models are consistent across all three datasets, they are present over three different assumptions on the negative class (i.e. items that are not seen or not liked), and they increase as comments become more abundant.",2-s2.0-84944088763,0,2016,Expert Systems with Applications,1

Personality, as defined in psychology, accounts for the individual differences in users’ preferences and behaviour. It has been found that there are significant correlations between personality and users’ characteristics that are traditionally used by recommender systems (e.g. music preferences, social media behaviour, learning styles etc.). Among the many models of personality, the Five Factor Model (FFM) appears suitable for usage in recommender systems as it can be quantitatively measured (i.e. numerical values for each of the factors, namely, openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness and neuroticism). The acquisition of the personality factors for an observed user can be done explicitly through questionnaires or implicitly using machine learning techniques with features extracted from social media streams or mobile phone call logs. There are, although limited, a number of available datasets to use in offline recommender systems experiment. Studies have shown that personality was successful at tackling the cold-start problem, making group recommendations, addressing cross-domain preferences and at generating diverse recommendations.

Within this in mind, our focus is on the area of complex social networks and the dynamic social network construction within the context of IoT. This is by highlighting and addressing the tagging issues of the objects to the real-world domain such as in disaster management, these are in relation to their hierarchies and interrelation within the context of social network analysis. Specifically, we suggest to investigate and deepen the understanding of the IoT paradigm through the application of social network analysis as a method for interlinking objects - and thus, propose ways in which IoT could be subsequently interlinked and analyzed through social network analysis approach - which provides possibilities for linking of the objects, while extends it into real-world domain.

The goal of influenza-like illness (ILI) surveillance is to determine the timing, location and magnitude of outbreaks by monitoring the frequency and progression of clinical case incidence. Advances in computational and information technology have allowed for automated collection of higher volumes of electronic data and more timely analyses than previously possible. Novel surveillance systems, including those based on internet search query data like Google Flu Trends (GFT), are being used as surrogates for clinically-based reporting of influenza-like-illness (ILI). We investigated the reliability of GFT during the last decade (2003 to 2013), and compared weekly public health surveillance with search query data to characterize the timing and intensity of seasonal and pandemic influenza at the national (United States), regional (Mid-Atlantic) and local (New York City) levels. We identified substantial flaws in the original and updated GFT models at all three geographic scales, including completely missing the first wave of the 2009 influenza A/H1N1 pandemic, and greatly overestimating the intensity of the A/H3N2 epidemic during the 2012/2013 season. These results were obtained for both the original (2008) and the updated (2009) GFT algorithms. The performance of both models was problematic, perhaps because of changes in internet search behavior and differences in the seasonality, geographical heterogeneity and age-distribution of the epidemics between the periods of GFT model-fitting and prospective use. We conclude that GFT data may not provide reliable surveillance for seasonal or pandemic influenza and should be interpreted with caution until the algorithm can be improved and evaluated. Current internet search query data are no substitute for timely local clinical and laboratory surveillance, or national surveillance based on local data collection. New generation surveillance systems such as GFT should incorporate the use of near-real time electronic health data and computational methods for continued model-fitting and ongoing evaluation and improvement.",2-s2.0-84887293587,1,2013,PLoS Computational Biology,1

The Digital Sexual Life History Calendar (d/SLHC) is a Web-based platform for collecting young adults’ sexual histories. In addition to collecting diverse data, the d/SLHC was designed to benefit participants by enabling reflection on their sexual and relationship experiences in the context of other life events and circumstances. In a pilot study of the d/SLHC, survey data were collected to test whether creating a d/SLHC timeline had any impact on sexual well-being. A sample of 18- to 25-year-old participants recruited through Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) completed an online survey about sexuality and relationships. Of those, 113 also completed d/SLHC timelines and 262 served as a comparison group. Six months later, participants from both groups were invited to complete a follow-up survey (total N = 249). Repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) results indicated that participants who completed d/SLHC timelines exhibited higher sexual esteem immediately following d/SLHC completion and at follow-up. No changes in sexual esteem were observed in the comparison group, and there were no differences between the groups with regard to sexual health behaviors and outcomes. These findings suggest that sexuality studies may have the potential to yield not only rich data for researchers but also rich experiences for participants.

Widespread access to the web is common these days for people; the Web 2.0 is a part of most people's lives and it is used for a variety of functions from searching for information, communicating with family, friends or colleagues, and ever more often learning. The difficulty with such learning, however, is delimiting what resources should actually be used, being able to access them both on an individual basis and collaboratively, and structuring the entire process. Massive open online courses (or MOOCs) appear to offer a solution to this problem, since they combine free unrestricted access with the benefits of structured courses. Language MOOCs are argued to combine the best of both formal and informal learning, bringing structured educational course content and activities together with appropriate social media tools and technologies. They appear to hold enormous potential for developing language competences, especially the productive and interactive ones, when compared to closed conventional online courses. However, part of the difficulty with designing and developing effective LMOOCs lies in selecting an appropriate MOOC platform (or philosophy, xMOOC or cMOOC) and associated tool set, and preparing the most effective resources and activities for the course.

Travel often inspires the creation of narratives about journeys and destinations, more so with the increasing availability of online platforms, applications for smartphones and tablets, and various other social media technologies. This book examines travel blogs and their associated social media as a form of selfpresentation that negotiates the tensions between discourses of travel and tourism. As such, it addresses how contemporary travellers use online platforms to communicate their experiences of journeys and destinations, and how the traveller/tourist dichotomy finds expression in these narratives. Addressing the need for more in-depth analysis through a study of blogs, this exploration of networked narratives of an individual’s travel experience considers personal motivations, self-promotion, and self-presentation as key factors in the creation of both personal and commercial travel blogs. As this text applies concepts such as self-presentation and heteroglossia, it will be of interest to both students and scholars of tourism, new media, sociology, cultural studies, and discourse studies.",2-s2.0-85021979862,1,2016,"Tourism, Travel, and Blogging: A Discursive Analysis of Online Travel Narratives",1

Results support the notion that use of social media contributes to heterogeneity of discussion networks and activities in civic life. More importantly, personality traits such as extraversion and openness to experiences were found to moderate the influence of social media on discussion network heterogeneity and civic participation, indicating that the contributing role of social media in increasing network heterogeneity and civic engagement is greater for introverted and less open individuals.",2-s2.0-84878721231,1,2013,Journal of Communication,1

Aims: The spatial aspect of Swedish seasonal influenza data was investigated and modelled with the main aim of finding patterns that could be useful for outbreak detection, i.e. for detecting an increase in incidence as soon as possible. Methods: Quality problems with data on laboratory-diagnosed cases (LDI) collected by a number of laboratories and other data were studied. Parametric and nonparametric regression methods were used for estimation of the excepted incidence. Multivariate analysis was used to determine the impact of different spatial components. Results: Quality problems were found for all types of data. LDI was found useful for the present aim. No evidence for a geographical pattern was found. It was found that the influenza outbreak started at about the same time in the metropolitan areas and about 1 week later in the rest of the country. Both parametric and nonparametric regression models are suggested. Conclusions: There was a time difference between the outbreaks in the metropolitan areas and the rest of the country. This can be utilised to improve outbreak detection.",2-s2.0-79957453235,0,2011,Scandinavian Journal of Public Health,1

Social media is being increasingly used to investigate opinions about drugs, diseases and procedures. In this descriptive exploratory study, we sought to investigate opinions about currently available MS treatments. Methods: The Twitter resource Topsy was searched for tweets mentioning the following MS treatments: Aubagio, Avonex, Betaferon or Betaseron, Copaxone, Extavia, Gilenya, Lemtrada, Novantrone, Rebif, Tysabri and Tecfidera between 1 Jan 2006 to 31 Jul 2014. Tweets were normalised and sentiment analysis performed. Results: In total, there were 60037 unique tweets mentioning an MS treatment. About half of the tweets contained non-neutral sentiment. Mean sentiment scores were different for treatments ranging from -0.191to 0.282 when investigating all tweets. These differences in sentiment scores between treatments were statistically significant 0.001. Sentiment scores tended to be higher for oral MS treatments than injectable treatments. Conclusions: Many tweets about MS treatments have a non-neutral sentiment.

Search engines are the prevalently used tools to collect information about individuals on the Internet. Search results typically comprise a variety of sources that contain personal information — either intentionally released by the person herself, or unintentionally leaked or published by third parties without being noticed, often with detrimental effects on the individual’s privacy. To grant individuals the ability to regain control over their disseminated personal information, the European Court of Justice recently ruled that EU citizens have a right to be forgotten in the sense that indexing systems, such as Google, must offer them technical means to request removal of links from search results that point to sources violating their data protection rights. As of now, these technical means consist of a web form that requires a user to manually identify all relevant links herself upfront and to insert them into the web form, followed by a manual evaluation by employees of the indexing system to assess if the request to remove those links is eligible and lawful. In this work, we propose a universal framework Oblivion to support the automation of the right to be forgotten in a scalable, provable and privacy-preserving manner. First, Oblivion enables a user to automatically find and tag her disseminated personal information using natural language processing (NLP) and image recognition techniques and file a request in a privacy-preserving manner. Second, Oblivion provides indexing systems with an automated and provable eligibility mechanism, asserting that the author of a request is indeed affected by an online resource. The automated eligibility proof ensures censorship-resistance so that only legitimately affected individuals can request the removal of corresponding links from search results. We have conducted comprehensive evaluations of Oblivion, showing that the framework is capable of handling 278 removal requests per second on a standard notebook (2.5 GHz dual core), and is hence suitable for large-scale deployment.",2-s2.0-84955267111,0,2015,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),1

The aggregation of these tags, also called a Folksonomy, can be used to build a collective characterization of the products in a simple and recognizable vocabulary. In this paper, we propose a family of methods called LinearTag recommenders, which infer users preferences for tags to formulate recommendations for them. We dubbed these inferred user profiles as TagProfiles. We present experiments using them as an interaction artifact that allows users to receive new recommendations as they delete, add or reorder tags in their profiles. Additional experiments using the Movielens dataset, show that the proposed methods generate recommendations with an error margin similar, or even lower than the results reported by methods based on latent factors. Next, we compared TagProfiles against KeywordProfiles, which are profiles based on keywords extracted automatically from textual descriptions of products. This comparison showed that TagProfiles are not only more precise in their predictions, but they are also more understandable by users. At last, we developed a user interface of a movie recommender based on TagProfiles, which we tested with 25 users.

After segmenting the sessions (i.e., periods of activity without a prolonged break) depending on their intensity (i.e., how many posts users produced during sessions), we observe a general decrease in the quality of comments produced by users over the course of sessions. We propose mixed-effects models that capture the impact of session intensity on comments, including their length, quality, and the responses they generate from the community. Our findings suggest performance deterioration: Sessions of increasing intensity are associated with the production of shorter, progressively less complex comments, which receive declining quality scores (as rated by other users), and are less and less engaging (i.e., they attract fewer responses).

We rely on the social influence model to predict and learn the influence diffusion process. However, traditional models only categorize nodes into two types of states, active and inactive. In addition, most previous models have only taken positive influences into account. Moreover, if inactive nodes are influenced successfully and turn into active nodes, these nodes cannot change their states forever. In this work, we not only break the above limitations but also propose a novel propagation method in our model. We proposes five states to represent the multiple states of influence. According to the new propagation method, the strength of the social influence may be reduced over time. Eventually, we utilize the measurement of precisions to compare with related models.

Communication plays an important role in mitigating, or exacerbating, the psychological and behavioral responses to critical incidents and disasters. As recent disasters demonstrated, people tend to converge to social media during and following emergencies. Authorities can then use this media and other computational methods to gain insights from the public, mainly to enhance situational awareness, but also to improve their communication with the public and public adherence to instructions. Methods: The current review presents a conceptual framework for studying psychological aspects of crisis and risk communication using the social media through social computing. Results: Advanced analytical tools can be integrated in the processes and objectives of crisis communication. The availability of the computational techniques can improve communication with the public by a process of Hyper-Targeted Crisis Communication.

Although there is a growing research body concerned with the analysis of the usage of social media during disasters, most previous work has concentrated on using social media as a stand-alone information source, whereas its combination with other information sources holds a still underexplored potential. This article presents an approach to enhance the identification of relevant messages from social media that relies upon the relations between georeferenced social media messages as Volunteered Geographic Information and geographic features of flood phenomena as derived from authoritative data (sensor data, hydrological data and digital elevation models). We apply this approach to examine the micro-blogging text messages of the Twitter platform (tweets) produced during the River Elbe Flood of June 2013 in Germany. This is performed by means of a statistical analysis aimed at identifying general spatial patterns in the occurrence of flood-related tweets that may be associated with proximity to and severity of flood events. The results show that messages near (up to 10 km) to severely flooded areas have a much higher probability of being related to floods. In this manner, we conclude that the geographic approach proposed here provides a reliable quantitative indicator of the usefulness of messages from social media by leveraging the existing knowledge about natural hazards such as floods, thus being valuable for disaster management in both crisis response and preventive monitoring.",2-s2.0-84930039252,1,2015,International Journal of Geographical Information Science,1

Neighbor-based collaborative ranking (NCR) techniques follow three consecutive steps to recommend items to each target user: first they calculate the similarities among users, then they estimate concordance of pairwise preferences to the target user based on the calculated similarities. Finally, they use estimated pairwise preferences to infer the total ranking of items for the target user. This general approach faces some problems and the rank data is usually sparse as users usually have compared only a few pairs of items. Consequently, the similarities among users is calculated based on limited information and is not accurate enough for inferring true values of preference concordance and can lead to an invalid ranking of items. This article presents a novel framework, called IteRank, that models the data as a bipartite network containing users and pairwise preferences. It then simultaneously refines users’ similarities and preferences’ concordances using a random walk method on this graph structure. It uses the information in this first step in another network structure for simultaneously adjusting the concordances of preferences and rankings of items. Using this approach, IteRank can overcome some existing problems caused by the sparsity of the data.

This paper proposes a measure of real-time inflation expectations based on metadata, i.e., data about data, constructed from internet search queries performed on the search engine Google. The forecasting performance of the Google Inflation Search Index (GISI) is assessed relative to 37 other indicators of inflation expectations-36 survey measures and the TIPS spread. For decades, the academic literature has focused on three measures of inflation expectations: the Livingston Survey, Survey of Professional Forecasters, and the Michigan Survey. While useful in developing models of forecasting inflation, these low frequency measures appear anachronistic in the modern era of higher frequency and real-time data. I demonstrate that higher frequency measures tend to outperform lower frequency measures in tests of accuracy, predictive power, and rationality. Furthermore, Granger Causality tests indicate that the GISI metadata indicator anticipates the inflation rate by 12 months, and out-of-sample forecasts show that the GISI has the lowest forecast error of all the inflation expectations indicators tested.",2-s2.0-84856417008,1,2011,Journal of Economic and Social Measurement,1
1077,17639,Stattner E.,Link formation in a telecommunication network,"Link formation in a telecommunication network. Traditional network generation models aim to replicate global structural properties observed on various real-world networks (power law degree distribution, short average distance, community structure, etc.) through synthetic link formation mechanisms such as triadic closure or preferential attachment. Nowadays the large amount of data available allows to study more precisely the link formation processes and to compare the models to real situations. In this work, we analyse the communication activities of the users of a mobile telephony operator for studying the link formation process. The communications emitted and received by users are strong indicators for understanding the underlying mechanisms of the link formation process and highlighting how user attributes correlate with the formation process in such a network. In a first study conducted at a global level we show that the traditional mechanisms commonly used in network generation models are not the main link formation mechanisms involved in this network. In a second study, we analyse more precisely the link formation process by searching for correlations between some user attributes and the formation of the new links. These results provide valuable guidelines to the design of more realistic generation models taking into account network structure and node attributes.",2-s2.0-84906751064,1,2014,Proceedings - International Conference on Research Challenges in Information Science,1

Social curation is the process through which the general public, rather than web publishers themselves, tag, organize, and share content with others. In this paper, I focus on the case of Pinterest, an image-based social curation site. I specifically highlight how the individual acts of collection on the site contribute to a new kind of public construction of knowledge online. This is specific to Pinterest, I argue, because the way that the site is set up—both in terms of its technological and business structure. My goals for the paper are as follows. First, I question how Pinterest’s notion of curation compares with traditional or already existing notions of professional curation and personal collection. Then, I offer an analysis of the activity on Pinterest; whereas users believe they are participating in personal acts of collection and reflexive identity building, I counteract this with an examination of the entire business “ecosystem” of the site, showing how these personal activities can also be understood as public acts of knowledge production. Finally, I question notions of agency and power within the context of this public/private divide on Pinterest and what implications this might have for social media at large.",2-s2.0-84928606044,1,2015,Critical Studies in Media Communication,1

The popularization of portable devices such as smartphones and the worldwide adoption of social media services make it increasingly possible to be connected and share data anywhere and at any time. Data from this process represent a new source of sensing, which is called participatory sensor network (PSN). In this scenario, people participate as social sensors voluntarily providing data that capture their experiences of daily life. This large amount of social data can provide valuable new forms of information to be obtained that are currently not available within the same global reach and that can be used to improve the decision-making processes of different entities (eg, people, groups, services, and applications). The objective of this chapter is to discuss PSNs, presenting an overview of the area, challenges, and opportunities. We aim to show that PSNs (eg, Instagram, Foursquare, and Waze) can act as valuable sources of large-scale sensing, providing access to important characteristics of city dynamics and urban social behavior, more quickly and comprehensively. This chapter starts by studying the properties of PSN. Next, it discusses how to work with PSN, showing its applicability in the development of more sophisticated applications.

The evolution of technology, along with the common use of different devices connected to the Internet, provides a vast growth in the volume and variety of data that are daily generated at high velocity, phenomenon commonly denominated as Big Data. Related with this, several Text Mining techniques make possible the extraction of useful insights from that data, benefiting the decision-making process across multiple areas, using the information, models, patterns or tendencies that these techniques are able to identify. With Sentiment Analysis, it is possible to understand which sentiments and opinions are implicit in this data. This paper proposes an architecture for Sentiment Analysis that uses data from the Twitter, which is able to collect, store, process and analyse data on a real-time fashion. To demonstrate its utility, practical applications are developed using real world examples where Sentiment Analysis brings benefits when applied. With the presented demonstration case, it is possible to verify the role of each used technology and the techniques adopted for Sentiment Analysis.

Information spreading in online social communities has attracted tremendous attention due to its utmost practical values in applications. Despite that several individual-level diffusion data have been investigated, we still lack the detailed understanding of the spreading pattern of information. Here, by comparing information flows and social links in a blog community, we find that the diffusion processes are induced by three different spreading mechanisms: social spreading, self-promotion and broadcast. Although numerous previous studies have employed epidemic spreading models to simulate information diffusion, we observe that such models fail to reproduce the realistic diffusion pattern. In respect to users behaviors, strikingly, we find that most users would stick to one specific diffusion mechanism. Moreover, our observations indicate that the social spreading is not only crucial for the structure of diffusion trees, but also capable of inducing more subsequent individuals to acquire the information. Our findings suggest new directions for modeling of information diffusion in social systems, and could inform design of efficient propagation strategies based on users behaviors.",2-s2.0-84930653500,1,2015,PLoS ONE,1

In the last few years thousands of scientific papers have investigated sentiment analysis, several startups that measure opinions on real data have emerged and a number of innovative products related to this theme have been developed. There are multiple methods for measuring sentiments, including lexical-based and supervised machine learning methods. Despite the vast interest on the theme and wide popularity of some methods, it is unclear which one is better for identifying the polarity (i.e., positive or negative) of a message. Accordingly, there is a strong need to conduct a thorough apple-to-apple comparison of sentiment analysis methods, as they are used in practice, across multiple datasets originated from different data sources. Such a comparison is key for understanding the potential limitations, advantages, and disadvantages of popular methods. This article aims at filling this gap by presenting a benchmark comparison of twenty-four popular sentiment analysis methods (which we call the state-of-the-practice methods). Our evaluation is based on a benchmark of eighteen labeled datasets, covering messages posted on social networks, movie and product reviews, as well as opinions and comments in news articles. Our results highlight the extent to which the prediction performance of these methods varies considerably across datasets.

We present a model to evaluate the relationship between the posts and SM skills. The aim of this study is twofold: first, to evaluate the quality of responses to the Snyder's Self-Monitoring Questionnaire (1974) collected via the Internet; and secondly, to explore the textual features of the posts in different SM-level groups. The prediction of posts resulted in an approximate 60% accuracy compared with the classification made by Snyder's SM scale. The variable ""family"" was found the most significant predictor in structured textual analysis via Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC). The emoticons and Internet slangs were extracted as the most robust classifiers in the unstructured textual analysis.

Additionally, individuals with more friends and with many network triangles (connected groups of three friends) tend to congregate in the city’s downtown at a rate that surpasses randomness.

In this paper, a graph based link prediction schema is proposed to infer implicit interests of the users towards emerging topics on Twitter. The underlying graph of our proposed work uses three types of information: user’s followerships, user’s explicit interests towards the topics, and the relatedness of the topics. To investigate the impact of each type of information on the accuracy of inferring user implicit interests, different variants of the underlying representation model are investigated along with several link prediction strategies in order to infer implicit interests.

Humans can perform many tasks with ease that remain difficult or impossible for computers. Crowdsourcing platforms like Amazon's Mechanical Turk make it possible to harness human-based computational power at an unprecedented scale. However, their utility as a general-purpose computational platform remains limited. The lack of complete automation makes it difficult to orchestrate complex or interrelated tasks. Scheduling more human workers to reduce latency costs real money, and jobs must be monitored and rescheduled when workers fail to complete their tasks. Furthermore, it is often difficult to predict the length of time and payment that should be budgeted for a given task. Finally, the results of humanbased computations are not necessarily reliable, both because human skills and accuracy vary widely, and because workers have a financial incentive to minimize their effort. This paper introduces AUTOMAN, the first fully automatic crowdprogramming system. AUTOMAN integrates humanbased computations into a standard programming language as ordinary function calls, which can be intermixed freely with traditional functions. This abstraction lets AUTOMAN programmers focus on their programming logic. An AUTOMAN program specifies a confidence level for the overall computation and a budget. The AUTOMAN runtime system then transparently manages all details necessary for scheduling, pricing, and quality control. AUTOMAN automatically schedules human tasks for each computation until it achieves the desired confidence level; monitors, reprices, and restarts human tasks as necessary; and maximizes parallelism across human workers while staying under budget.

Social networking sites (SNSs) are one of the Web 2.0's most utilized services, and the influential force of electronic word of mouth (eWOM) on SNSs deserves our unequivocal attention. This study aims to explore how users of SNSs adopt information embedded in eWOM reviews shared by other users. Using the stimulus-organism-response model and affect-as-information theory, we devised and tested a theoretical framework linking both a cognitive path and an affective path to approach eWOM adoption on SNSs. Two curiosity constructs - informational deprivation epistemic curiosity (D-EC) and interest-type epistemic curiosity (I-EC) - are regarded as moderators of the cognitive path and the affective path, respectively. Data collected from 445 respondents support all of our hypotheses. The results show that beyond the conventional cognitive path (cognitive stimuli and the credibility of eWOM), the affective path (affective stimuli and arousal) can also contribute to eWOM adoption. We also find that SNS users focus on different stimuli of SNSs, depending on their levels of D-EC and I-EC.

The basic characteristics of extreme events are their infrequence and potential damages to the human–nature system. It is difficult for people to design comprehensive policies for dealing with such events due to time pressure and their limit knowledge about rare and uncertain sequential impacts. Recently, online media provides digital source of individual and public information to study collective human responses to extreme events, which can help us reduce the damages of an extreme event and improve the efficiency of disaster relief. More specifically, there are different emotional responses (e.g., anxiety and anger) to an event and its subevents during a whole event, which can be reflected in the contents of public news and social media to a certain degree. Therefore, an online computational method for extracting these contents can help us better understand human emotional states at different stages of an event, reveal underlying reasons, and improve the efficiency of event relief. Here, we first employ tweets and reports extracted from Twitter and ReliefWeb for text analysis on three distinct events. Then, we detect textual contents by sentiment lexicon to find out human emotional responses over time. Moreover, a clustering-based method is proposed to detect emotional responses to a certain episode during events based on the co-occurrences of words as used in tweets and/or articles.

Based on the results of the analysis, we have discovered four underlying rules of urban dynamics: low intrinsic dimensionality, three categories of common patterns, dominance of periodic trends, and temporal stability. It implies that the spacetime structure can be captured well by remarkably few temporal or spatial predictable periodic patterns, and the structure unearthed by PCA evolves stably over time.

The action-based model of dissonance theorizes that when individuals have conflicting cognitions with action implications, they experience dissonance. This dissonance motivates the individual to value one action tendency over the other, thereby facilitating effective action. Thus, a decrease in the motivation to act (decreased approach motivation) should decrease this tendency to value one action tendency over the other (dissonance reduction). The present research tested this prediction by using an embodied manipulation, a supine posture, to decrease approach motivation. In Experiment 1, relative to an upright posture, a supine posture decreased dissonance reduction in an effort justification paradigm. In Experiment 2, a supine posture decreased the spreading of alternatives following a difficult decision. These results suggest that embodied manipulations that reduce approach motivation decrease dissonance reduction.

When one is reflecting on a career as a practitioner, a number of important influences, themes, and elements that contribute to being a successful practitioner are evident. The achievement of this success is not a solitary activity. Many role models and mentors serve as important influences and guides for developing as a professional over the course of one's career. Ultimately, the goal is to aspire to become a complete practitioner.

Describes a new theory of motivation and its applications to addiction and aversion. It assumes that many hedonic, affective, or emotional states are automatically opposed by CNS mechanisms which reduce the intensity of hedonic feelings, both pleasant and aversive. Opponent processes for most hedonic states are strengthened by use and weakened by disuse. These assumptions lead to deductions of many known facts about acquired motivation. The theory also suggests several new lines of research on motivation. It argues that the establishment of some types of acquired motivation does not depend on conditioning and is nonassociative in nature. Relationships between conditioning processes and postulated opponent processes are discussed. It is argued that the data on several types of acquired motivation, arising from either pleasurable or aversive stimulation, can be fruitfully reorganized and understood within the framework provided by the opponent-process model.

Strong and consistent gender differences exist in mental health problems and crime. Females suffer more from internalizing problems, including depression and anxiety, while males predominate in externalizing problems, which include delinquency, aggression, and substance abuse. These gender differences vary by race, however. Although gender differences in externalizing problems remain considerable across race, gender differences in internalizing problems are far greater for whites than African Americans. In explaining these patterns, our perspective differs from prior theories in both mental health and criminology by focusing on the intersection of gender and race in relation to both internalizing and externalizing problems. We propose that gender and race affect internalizing and externalizing problems through their impact on schemas about self-salience, which refer to beliefs about the importance of the self versus the collective in social relations. In testing this perspective, we examine a sample of white and African American males and females in adolescence, the point at which these patterns arise. We find that gender and race interact to shape schemas about self-salience. Further, these differences in self-salience help to explain the disparities by gender and race in internalizing and externalizing problems.",2-s2.0-33646133674,7,2006,Social Problems,0

We take up this challenge by presenting a zero-intelligence model of government formation. In our model, three or more parties that care about office and policy make random government proposals. The only constraints that we impose on government formation correspond to the two binding constitutional constraints that exist in all parliamentary systems: An incumbent government always exists and all governments must enjoy majority legislative support.

Most real-world risky decisions are based on imprecise probabilities. Although people generally demonstrate vagueness aversion, behaving as if vaguely specified probabilities are worse than comparable precisely specified probabilities, vagueness seeking also occurs. Previous explanations of vagueness preferences have been based on individual differences and regressive beliefs about extreme probabilities, and little research has examined the effect of changes in the way vagueness is communicated to the decision maker. The present study demonstrates that gain/loss framing, moderated by the operationalization of vagueness, influences how people respond to vagueness about a probability estimate. Subjects read scenarios describing consumer purchases, organizational marketing decisions, and medical treatments, and expressed preference between options having either precisely or vaguely described probabilities. Vagueness was operationalized either as a range of possible values or as verbal qualification of a single point estimate. Negative framing was associated with greater preference for vague prospects, unless vagueness was described by a numerical range with the higher value presented first, indicating a substantial primacy order effect. A second experiment demonstrates that negative framing led people to make more favorable inferences about the likelihoods of vague probabilities.",2-s2.0-0031185085,3,1997,Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes,0

Prior research on stratification beliefs has investigated individuals' understandings regarding the causes of poverty in America. These past studies have uncovered demographic characteristics associated with individualist and structuralist explanations for poverty. In the current study, we will argue that Americans, like social scientists, envision poverty as a heterogeneous and complex phenomenon. We utilize a cultural cognition theoretical approach to conceptualize these understandings of poverty as schemas. We contend that a schema of poverty contains a set of unique associations regarding both demographic beliefs (who the poor are) and causal attributions (why they are poor). Using original data in a mixed-methods design that incorporates inductive and experimental components, we find that people differentiate between two key types of poverty: Intergenerational poverty and downward mobility. People perceive each type of poverty as caused by a different set of factors and as experienced by a different group of people. The type of poverty envisioned is, in most cases, as important as or more important than a respondent's own demographic characteristics in predicting what type of causal attributions he or she makes for poverty.

Discriminability was manipulated by presenting actions either with or without a key visual identity cue, i.e., the actor's face. We also examined whether self-other confusions in the face-visible condition depend on attentional focus (directed to the observed action vs. the actor's face). In the action-only condition, observation inflation was significant and greater than in the face-visible conditions, in which the effect was moderated by attentional focus: It persisted under an action focus but was eliminated under a face focus. Findings for correct memories of self-performance suggest that the reduced effect is not merely due to weaker encoding of the actions themselves.

Prior research documents performance improvements following the implementation of pay-for-performance (PFP) bonus plans. However, bonus plans typically pay for performance relative to a goal, and the manager whose performance is to be evaluated often participates in setting the goal. In these settings, PFP affects managers' incentive to influence goal levels in addition to affecting performance effort. Prior field research is silent on the effect of PFP on goals, the focus of this paper. Using sales and sales goal data from 61 stores of a U.S. retail firm over 10 quarters, we find that the introduction of a performance-based bonus plan with participative goal setting is accompanied by lower goals that are more accurate predictors of subsequent sales performance. Statistical tests indicate that increased goal accuracy is attributable to managers ""meeting but not beating"" goals and to new information being impounded in goals. We further investigate how differences among managers are associated with goal levels. We find significant ""manager effects"" but no ""supervisor effects."" In additional tests we find that cross-sectional differences among managers are related to differing marginal returns to slackbuilding effort. Turning to the role of new information on goals, we find that prior period performance has incremental power to explain goal levels in the postplan period. Our results provide field-based evidence that PFP and participative goal setting affect the level and accuracy of goals, effects that are associated with both information exchange and with managers' incentives to influence goals.",2-s2.0-74849083233,3,2010,Management Science,0

The purpose of this paper is to clarify the theory of international economic sanctions and to provide estimates of the short-run economic impact on South Africa of externally imposed reductions of the imports and capital flows into that country. A macroeconomic picture of South Africa 's “dependence” is drawn, and the economy 's vulnerability in the short run is seen to be in its capacity to import, not in exports or capital flows. Trade and capital sanctions most clearly damage South Afnca 's growth potential; the short-run impact is harder to quantify. A static linear programming model of the South African economy is constructed in an attempt at this quantification. This model estimates that small sanctions would have small impact—i.e., if imports were reduced by less than one-fourth, GDP would be cut by only about one half as large a percentage as imports. Larger import reductions cause greater damage. If imports were to be cut in half, not only would GDP be seriously reduced but massive unemployment and relocation of white labor would occur.",2-s2.0-84965636036,5,1979,Journal of Conflict Resolution,0

Although the past decade has witnessed increased usage of ecological data to map the community-level effects of religion, the vast majority of studies in this body of scholarship continue to be plagued by two key shortcomings. First, ecological research on religion is often conducted in an atheoretical manner, one that privileges the structural character of religion while failing to demonstrate sensitivity to the substance of collectively held religious beliefs and values. Second, ecological scholarship often employs crude methodological techniques that overlook noteworthy distinctions within large religious collectivities (e.g., variants of conservative Protestantism, Catholicism and Judaism). This study charts new theoretical and methodological directions in the use of ecological data by exploring the complex linkages between religious ecology and mortality in the United States. We hypothesize that the other-worldly theology and individualistic orientation found in conservative Protestantism dampens this faith tradition's commitment to population health, thereby leading to demonstrably different outcomes in mortality by denominational families. Also, drawing on previous work that criticizes the ""monolithic bloc"" depiction of conservative Protestantism, we hypothesize that important distinctions in mortality will be found when sub-groups of conservative Protestants (evangelicals, Pentecostals and fundamentalists) are compared because each of these factions exhibits distinct degrees of other-worldliness. Using restricted county-level data from the National Center for Health Statistics and 2000 Churches and Church Congregations data, we observe noteworthy religious differences in mortality, thereby underscoring a need for the development of more sophisticated theoretical and methodological approaches to the ecological study of religion.

Prior studies examining factors that influence the learning curve mainly focus on settings in which firms adopt new products or technologies or open new plants or assembly lines. Less is known, however, about how more mature firms learn, when they are further down the learning curve. To gain insight into factors that enhance learning in this situation, I examine factors that increase both the ability and the opportunity to learn. I hypothesize that the ability to learn is enhanced by the presence of a moderate amount of temporary employees in the workforce and by providing employees with related variation in tasks, measured by product heterogeneity. In addition, I hypothesize that opportunities for learning are created when there is some slack in resources and when there are no problems in other important performance dimensions that consume employee attention. These hypotheses are examined using data of the Royal Dutch Mail, which has 27 geographically dispersed regions. Although these 27 regions are homogeneous with respect to their tasks, internal organization, type of products delivered, and technology used, their learning rates differ considerably. In the sample of 972 observations used for this analysis, I find that this variation in learning rates is explained by the percentage of temporary employees used, the level of excess capacity, the degree of product heterogeneity, and the degree to which regions face problems in other important performance dimensions. These findings provide insight into strategies that help managers in designing work processes to maintain a positive learning curve.",2-s2.0-38549146488,3,2007,Management Science,0

Our analysis formalizes the notion of barriers to imitation, particularly those based on time compression diseconomies where the faster a firm develops a resource, the greater the cost. Time compression diseconomies are derived from a micromodel of resource development with diminishing returns to effort. We use a continuous time model of the flows of development costs and market revenues, which allows us to integrate strategic and financial analyses of firm investment problems. We examine two dimensions of sustainability: whether the resources underlying a firm's competitive advantage are economically imitable and, if so, how long imitation takes. Surprisingly, we show that sustainable competitive advantage does not necessarily lead to superior performance. We find that imitators sometimes benefit from reductions in their absorptive capacity and that innovators should license either all or none of their knowledge.

Improving the recognition of political-economic factors in the creation of disasters. Disaster studies have made important progress in recognizing the unequally distributed consequences of disasters, but there has been less progress in analyzing social factors that help create ""natural"" disasters. Even well-known patterns of hazard-creation tend to be interpreted generically - as representing ""economic development"" or ""capitalism"" - rather than through focusing on the more specific dynamics involved. We illustrate this point with two recent and well-known cases of flooding - those in the upper Mississippi River Valley and in the Katrina-related devastation of New Orleans. In the former case, damage was caused in part by building the very kinds of higher and stronger floodwalls that were shown to be inadequate in the latter. In the New Orleans case, a more important factor in the death and destruction was the excavation of a transportation canal. In both cases, and many more, the underlying causes of damage to humans as well as to the environment has involved a three-part pattern, supported by the political system - spreading the costs, concentrating the economic benefits and hiding the real risks. In very real senses, these have been floods of folly, created not just by extreme weather events, but by deadly and avoidable patterns of political-economic choices.

In this research, we examined the impact of physiological arousal on negotiation outcomes. Conventional wisdom and the prescriptive literature suggest that arousal should be minimized given its negative effect on negotiations, whereas prior research on misattribution of arousal suggests that arousal might polarize outcomes, either negatively or positively. In two experiments, we manipulated arousal and measured its effect on subjective and objective negotiation outcomes. Our results support the polarization effect. When participants had negative prior attitudes toward negotiation, arousal had a detrimental effect on outcomes, whereas when participants had positive prior attitudes toward negotiation, arousal had a beneficial effect on outcomes. These effects occurred because of the construal of arousal as negative or positive affect, respectively. Our findings have important implications not only for negotiation, but also for research on misattribution of arousal, which previously has focused on the target of evaluation, in contrast to the current research, which focused on the critical role of the perceiver.",2-s2.0-84885336929,6,2013,Psychological Science,0

In animal communication natural selection favors callers who vocalize to affect the behavior of listeners and listeners who acquire information from vocalizations, using this information to represent their environment. The acquisition of information in the wild is similar to the learning that occurs in laboratory conditioning experiments. It also has some parallels with language. The dichotomous view that animal signals must be either referential or emotional is false, because they can easily be both: The mechanisms that cause a signaler to vocalize do not limit a listener's ability to extract information from the call. The inability of most animals to recognize the mental states of others distinguishes animal communication most clearly from human language. Whereas signalers may vocalize to change a listener's behavior, they do not call to inform others.

The authors discuss the use of experimental choice menus for assessing customers' preferences and price sensitivities for the variety of features and options that might be offered by a firm in its choiceboard. The proposed approach directly analyzes customers' portfolio of choices from each of several experimental menus by estimating the utility for each menu item as a function of its characteristics, its price, and other specific attributes such as multifeature discounts. The authors accommodate customer heterogeneity in the utilities, allow for correlation of the utilities across items, and incorporate constraints in menu choices.

Several normative political theorists argue for racially descriptive representation, or for blacks to represent blacks. I contend that if theorists believe that blacks deserve additional measures to improve their substantive political representation, then they should prioritize the creation of racial constituencies independently of whether such constituencies elect black representatives. Prioritizing racial constituency circumvents essentialism within descriptive representation and better reflects the role of electoral authorization and accountability in generating trust between representatives and constituents. As a result, descriptive representation becomes one of several criteria (along with other identity markers, ideological proximity, and general competence and trustworthiness) to be applied by a racial constituency in selecting a preferable representative. Ultimately, prioritizing racial constituency allows normative theorists to affirm, without philosophical contradiction, the existence of black districts that elect nonblack representatives; contain black ideological minorities; exhibit diverse political interests; reflect shifting electoral constituencies; and elect representatives with divergent representational styles.",2-s2.0-82455171711,5,2011,Journal of Politics,0

Can nuclear states deter attacks against their friends by simply announcing their defense commitments? Or must they deploy nuclear weapons on a protégé's territory before an alliance is seen as credible? Using a new dataset on foreign nuclear deployments from 1950 to 2000, our analysis reveals two main findings. First, formal alliances with nuclear states appear to carry significant deterrence benefits. Second, however, stationing nuclear weapons on a protégé's territory does not bolster these effects.

What accounts for the prevalence of these judgments, given that their validity is at best uncertain? We hypothesized that the tendency to reason from “is” to “ought” is due in part to a systematic bias in people’s (nonmoral) explanations, whereby regularities (e.g., giving roses on Valentine’s Day) are explained predominantly via inherent or intrinsic facts (e.g., roses are beautiful). In turn, these inherence-biased explanations lead to value-laden downstream conclusions (e.g., it is good to give roses). Consistent with this proposal, results from five studies (N = 629 children and adults) suggested that, from an early age, the bias toward inherence in explanations fosters inferences that imbue observed reality with value. Given that explanations fundamentally determine how people understand the world, the bias toward inherence in these judgments is likely to exert substantial influence over sociomoral understanding.",2-s2.0-84981165349,6,2016,Psychological Science,0

This review examines research on white racial and ethnic identity, paying special attention to developments in whiteness studies during the past decade. Although sociologists have long focused on white ethnic identity, considerations of white racial identity are more recent. White racial identity is commonly portrayed as a default racial category, an invisible yet privileged identity formed by centuries of oppression of nonwhite groups. Whiteness has become synonymous with privilege in much scholarly writing, although recent empirical work strives to consider white racial identity as a complex, situated identity rather than a monolithic one. The study of white racial identity can greatly benefit from moving away from simply naming whiteness as an overlooked, privileged identity and by paying closer attention to empirical studies of racial and ethnic identity by those studying social movements, ethnic identity, and social psychology.

Fewer still consistently demonstrate that centralization is indeed a common response to external threats in all states. This article therefore develops a comprehensive theory of domestic change in the shadow of external threat. Salient threats to the state create strong incentives for opposition forces to support the leader in power, even in non-democracies. The leadership then uses these favorable domestic political climates to decrease the number of institutional veto points that can stop future leader-driven policy changes. Collectively, this two-part theory provides a unified model of domestic behavioral change (also known as rally effects) and institutional centralization (defined by a declining number of veto players). In addition, by defining salient threats as challenges to homeland territory, the article provides some of the first domestic-level evidence that territorial disputes are fundamentally different from other types of international conflicts.",2-s2.0-77954835216,5,2010,Journal of Conflict Resolution,0

Women's access to the political debate is limited, because they are given proportionally less time to speak than male witnesses. Further, empirical measures indicate that the effectiveness of women's testimony is undermined by senators' responses.

The consequences include weak connections between theory and tests, biased estimates, and incorrect inferences. We outline techniques for estimating linear dynamic regressions with stationary data and weakly exogenous regressors.

How liberal ideals helped justify mid nineteenth-century exclusionary policies. Theory: Too much credit has been given to liberalism as the ideology of inclusion. Moreover, it is an oversimplification to suggest that America's exclusionary policies arose either because liberal ideals were misapplied or because illiberal values such as republicanism or ethnocentrism prevailed. Hypothesis: Neither the theory of misapplied liberalism nor of widespread illiberalism fully explains the ideological origins of America's long-term practice of selective political inclusion. Instead, exclusions and liberalism lived side by side in large part because liberal ideology was a tradition of sufficient ambiguity. Methods: The author looks at a sample of state constitutional conventions held during the first half of the nineteenth century. The author focuses on speeches therein that deal with questions of who should participate in leader selection (and why) and analyzes how answers to that question differ according to the race of whose power is at stake. Results: Debates over how far to empower freemen of African descent verify recent studies which argue that ethnocentric language rationalized political exclusions. In debates over white empowerment, however, those arguing to restrict citizen privileges unequivocally used the language of liberalism to make their case. This suggests that nineteenth-century liberalism was not just the language of greater empowerment and inclusion; it was dynamic enough to serve as the language of exclusion as well.",2-s2.0-0032379177,5,1998,American Journal of Political Science,0

The relationship between economic interdependence and international conflict is a burgeoning research topic. Previous research has examined the role of interstate conflict on bilateral total trade. Civil wars also have severe consequences on society and are not uncommon. This article seeks to shed light on this relationship by examining the impact of civil war in one country on the total bilateral trade between the afflicted state and its trade partners. The repercussions of civil war participation on a militarily intervening third party's trade also receive scrutiny. Furthermore, the outcome of the civil war is investigated to determine whether all war terminations have the same effects on trade. Finally, this article questions whether the effects of civil wars can be mitigated by security partnerships. One key finding from analyses of 120 countries between 1950 and 1992 is that civil wars decrease bilateral trade between states by one-third. In addition, the findings indicate that the effects of civil wars on trade are not limited to countries where the civil wars are occurring but also affect joiners. Furthermore, the outcome types of civil wars have repercussions for future bilateral trade and, under certain situations, their effects can be alleviated.",2-s2.0-9344252216,5,2004,Journal of Peace Research,0

In our benchmark model, markups correspond to the prices of differentiated inputs relative to that of undifferentiated final product. If nominal prices of differentiated goods are relatively sticky, unexpected inflation reduces markups, mimicking the effects of increased competition. Similar effects stem from reductions in markups of foreign intermediates and unexpected inflation abroad. The models imply that prices of less competitive goods are more countercyclical.

According to the audience-side perspective, audience members refer to established categories to make sense of products. Products that incorporate features from multiple categories are perceived to be poor fits with category expectations and less appealing than category specialists. The producer-side view holds that spanning categories reduces one's ability to effectively target each category's audience, which decreases appeal to audience members. Rather than treating these as rival explanations, we propose that both processes matter and offer a systematic, integrated account of how penalties arise as a consequence of audience-side and producer-side processes. We analyze data from two dissimilar contexts, eBay auctions and U.S. feature-film projects, to test the central implications of our theory.

We investigated the impact of uncertainty on leadership preferences and propose that the conjunction of self-esteem level and stability is an important moderator in this regard. Self-threatening uncertainty is aversive and activates the motivation to regain control. People with high and stable self-esteem should be confident of achieving this goal by self-determined amelioration of the situation and should therefore show a stronger preference for democratic leadership under conditions of uncertainty. By contrast, people with low and unstable self-esteem should place their trust and hope in the abilities of powerful others, resulting in a preference for autocratic leadership. Studies 1a and 1b validate explicit and implicit leadership measures and demonstrate a general prodemocratic default attitude under conditions of certainty.

Findings of two empirical studies in the hotel industry indicate that consumers perceive higher risks in step-up extensions than in step-down extensions, which consequently influences their evaluations of the extensions. This effect of extension direction is also found to be moderated by risk relievers such as service guarantee and consumers' prior knowledge in the service category. Furthermore, we found that a parent brand receives more positive evaluations after the introduction of a step-up extension than that of a step-down extension.

The need to hide sensitive information before sharing databases has long been recognized. In the context of data mining, sensitive information often takes the form of itemsets that need to be suppressed before the data is released. This paper considers the problem of minimizing the number of nonsensitive itemsets lost while concealing sensitive ones. It is shown to be an intractably large version of an NP-hard problem. Consequently, a two-phased procedure that involves the solution of two smaller NP-hard problems is proposed as a practical and effective alternative. In the first phase, a procedure to solve a sanitization problem identifies how the support for sensitive itemsets could be eliminated from a specific transaction by removing the fewest number of items from it. This leads to a modified frequent itemset hiding problem, where transactions to be sanitized are selected such that the number of nonsensitive itemsets lost, while concealing sensitive ones, is minimized. Heuristic procedures are developed for these problems using intuition derived from their integer programming formulations. Results from computational experiments conducted on a publicly available retail data set and three large data sets generated using IBM's synthetic data generator indicate that these approaches are very effective, solving problems involving up to 10 million transactions in a short period of time. The results also show that the process of sanitization has considerable bearing on the quality of solutions obtained.",2-s2.0-33847045247,3,2007,Management Science,0

The blurring of managerial and professional jurisdictions remains a significant area of organizational research. This process is often described as involving 're-stratification', the drawing of professional elites into bureaucratic roles; or 'bureaucratization', the standardization of work operating procedures. We examine these processes further through considering how professional work is reordered through the application of knowledge management techniques, focusing in particular on the management of knowledge around clinical risk. We suggest attempts by hospital risk managers to manage medical knowledge towards organizational learning represent a significant challenge to clinical freedom, given the centrality of expert knowledge to professional autonomy. In considering this challenge, we are attentive to the idea that change occurs not through the top-down challenge of management, nor the bottom-up resistance of professionals, but through the dynamic mediation of these influences within a wider institutional context. Accordingly, we find that doctors respond to change through a number of situated responses that limit management control over knowledge and reinforce claims to medical autonomy. In extending professional jurisdiction for the management of knowledge, we show how professionals such as doctors can themselves become managerialized as they seek to stave off managerial encroachment. Rather than seeing professionals as being drawn into management roles or bureaucratic ways of working, we suggest that managerial techniques and jurisdictions are also strategically drawn into professional practice and identity.

Can mouth movements shape attitudes? When people articulate different consonants (e.g., B or K) they press the tongue and the lips against various spots in the mouth. This allows for construction of words that feature systematic wanderings of consonantal stricture spots either from the front to the rear (inward; e.g., BENOKA) or from the rear to the front (outward; e.g., KENOBA) of the mouth. These wanderings of muscular strictures resemble the oral kinematics during either deglution (swallowing-like, inward movement) or expectoration (spitting-like, outward movement). Thus, we predicted that the articulation of inward and outward words induces motivational states associated with deglutition and expectoration-namely, approach and avoidance-which was tested in 9 experiments (total N = 822). Inward words were preferred over outward words, being labeled as nonsense words (Experiments 1, 4, 5, 6, and 9), company names (Experiment 2), or person names (Experiments 3, 7, and 8), with control words falling in between (Experiment 5).

Organizational identification has been argued to have a unique value in explaining individual attitudes and behaviors in organizations, as it involves the essential definition of entities (i.e., individual and organizational identities). This review seeks meta-analytic evidence of the argument by examining how this identity-relevant construct functions in the nexus of attitudinal/behavioral constructs. The findings show that, first, organizational identification is significantly associated with key attitudes (job involvement, job satisfaction, and affective organizational commitment) and behaviors (in-role performance and extra-role performance) in organizations. Second, in the classic psychological model of attitude-behavior relations (Fishbein & Ajzen, 1975), organizational identification is positioned as a basis from which general sets of those attitudes and behaviors are engendered; organizational identification has a direct effect on general behavior above and beyond the effect of general attitude. Third, the effects of organizational identification are moderated by national culture, a higher-level social context wherein the organization is embedded, such that the effects are stronger in a collectivistic culture than in an individualistic culture. Theoretical and practical implications of the findings and future research directions are discussed.",2-s2.0-84939569960,6,2015,Psychological Bulletin,0

Lane criticized experiments that had demonstrated contrasting tendencies toward ""categorical"" perception of stop consonants and ""continuous"" perception of vowels and nonspeech sounds. He also undertook to demonstrate that categorical perception of nonspeech sounds can be produced by the ordinary procedures of discrimination training, and so to refute the claim that such perception is an interesting characteristic of the speech mode. It is shown that contrary to Lane's claim, discrimination training is not sufficient to produce categorical perception. (34 ref.)

Most of this research neither examines whether the fundamentalism/sexism association differs between genders, nor explores whether individual-level measures of fundamentalism more likely applicable to women (personal beliefs about the Bible as literally true) have different relationships to sexism than the more typically used group- level measure (denominational affiliation). Analysis of covariance of data from the 1985 and 1988 General Social Surveys reveals that both individual and group fundamentalism are connected with sexism in the entire sample, but mainly because of opposing tendencies by gender. For women, sexism is related to fundamentalist personal beliefs rather than to fundamentalist affiliations. For men, the opposite occurs: sexism is related to fundamentalist affiliations rather than to personal beliefs in the literalness of the Bible.

We develop a cultural evolutionary theory of the origins of prosocial religions and apply it to resolve two puzzles in human psychology and cultural history: (1) the rise of large-scale cooperation among strangers and, simultaneously, (2) the spread of prosocial religions in the last 10-12 millennia. We argue that these two developments were importantly linked and mutually energizing. We explain how a package of culturally evolved religious beliefs and practices characterized by increasingly potent, moralizing, supernatural agents, credible displays of faith, and other psychologically active elements conducive to social solidarity promoted high fertility rates and large-scale cooperation with co-religionists, often contributing to success in intergroup competition and conflict. In turn, prosocial religious beliefs and practices spread and aggregated as these successful groups expanded, or were copied by less successful groups. This synthesis is grounded in the idea that although religious beliefs and practices originally arose as nonadaptive by-products of innate cognitive functions, particular cultural variants were then selected for their prosocial effects in a long-term, cultural evolutionary process. This framework (1) reconciles key aspects of the adaptationist and by-product approaches to the origins of religion, (2) explains a variety of empirical observations that have not received adequate attention, and (3) generates novel predictions.

According to the majority-minority paradigm, racial and ethnic minorities have lower socioeconomic characteristics than whites owing to discrimination. Asian Americans defy this conventional view, however, at least on average. Asian Americans tend to have higher mean levels of educational achievements, and several recent studies indicate approximate parity with whites in most arenas of the labor market for those Asian Americans who were schooled in the United States. Their favorable socioeconomic outcomes stand in contrast to the widespread discrimination and labor market disadvantages that Asian Americans encountered during the earlier part of the twentieth century. The improved opportunities for Asian Americans suggest increasingly successful interrelations with whites in the postCivil Rights era, with its more multicultural ethos. Less encouragingly, the favorable average socioeconomic profile of Asian Americans in the postCivil Rights era in part reflects the rising significance of class resources and associated inequalities. The latter trend is evident in the notable socioeconomic variability within the racial category of Asian Americans. Copyright",2-s2.0-73149119161,7,2009,Annual Review of Sociology,0

We construct a Generalized Empirical Likelihood estimator for a GARCH(1, 1) model with a possibly heavy tailed error. The estimator imbeds tail-trimmed estimating equations allowing for over-identifying conditions, asymptotic normality, efficiency and empirical likelihood based confidence regions for very heavy-tailed random volatility data. We show the implied probabilities from the tail-trimmed Continuously Updated Estimator elevate weight for usable large values, assign large but not maximum weight to extreme observations, and give the lowest weight to non-leverage points. We derive a higher order expansion for GEL with imbedded tail-trimming (GELITT), which reveals higher order bias and efficiency properties, available when the GARCH error has a finite second moment. Higher order asymptotics for GEL without tail-trimming requires the error to have moments of substantially higher order. We use first order asymptotics and higher order bias to justify the choice of the number of trimmed observations in any given sample. We also present robust versions of Generalized Empirical Likelihood Ratio, Wald, and Lagrange Multiplier tests, and an efficient and heavy tail robust moment estimator with an application to expected shortfall estimation. Finally, we present a broad simulation study for GEL and GELITT, and demonstrate profile weighted expected shortfall for the Russian Ruble-US Dollar exchange rate.

The realist, state-centric paradigm of international relations is reevaluated in light of the emerging role of transnational social movements and nongovernmental organizations. It is argued that global civil society potentially poses both an empirical and normative challenge to realist assumptions. It is shown that realist theory is grounded in the Hobbesian assumption that human beings are naturally avaricious, thus justifying both the state's monopoly of the legitimate use of violence and the anarchical, state-centric system. In contrast to the Hobbesian assumption, global civil society is widely characterized by voluntary cooperation and non-violent political action. It is argued that the Kropotkian tradition of anarchist theory provides a useful counterpoint to the Hobbesian tradition in conceptualizing global civil society. This alternative anarchist tradition views the state itself as the major source of violence in the world, and it highlights the sorts of non-violent, cooperative activities that largely characterize contemporary global civil society. By interjecting an alternative set of assumptions concerning human nature and anarchism, the Kropotkian tradition supports a potentially auspicious reevaluation of the prospects for peaceful international governance in an era of global transformation of the familiar state-centric world order.",2-s2.0-0032332354,5,1998,Journal of Peace Research,0

An experiment is reported that compared juror vs jury sensitivity to biasing information (viz., prejudicial pretrial publicity) for versions of a legal case with a moderate and an extreme conviction rate. Consistent with the SDS analysis, juries were more biased than jurors for the moderate-case version, but the reverse was true for the extreme-case version.

Consistent with our theoretical predictions, the effect of monitoring capacity on PRI votes varies nonlinearly with the distance of voters to the polling station: it first increases because rural voters-facing larger costs of voting-generally favor the PRI, before declining as the cost of incentivizing brokers increases.

Importantly, this article highlights three factors that affect the balance in social order and thus are critical in consumer-to-consumer punishment decisions. First, when a third party in the consumption environment restores social order through punishment, consumers will refrain from punishing further (study 1). Second, punishment is mitigated when the norm violator faces an unjustified adversity, as punishment would create a further imbalance in social order (studies 2a and 2b). Third, the level of punishment required to achieve social order is reduced for a higher status norm violator (study 3).

The study of social violence in Latin America has stood at the periphery of cross-national research despite the region being one of the most violent in the contemporary world. This article provides a comprehensive review of theories of crime and presents an empirical analysis of social violence in Latin America from 1980 to 2010. The literature often emphasizes one theoretical approach over others and existing explanations are seen as competitive rather than complementary. Yet, the empirical findings of this study support different explanations and illustrate how considering different theoretical approaches helps improve our knowledge on social violence phenomena. The results from different estimation methods reveal that youth bulges, female workforce, and post-conflict states are positively associated with social violence, as measured by homicide rates. The results also show that states’ efforts to strengthen judicial system capacity and increase school attendance can promote peace. Moreover, while drug producers and/or transit countries are not systematically related to social violence, money-laundering countries experience higher homicide rates, suggesting that not all dimensions of drug-markets increase violence. Whereas Latin America as a whole has experienced few episodes of civil wars in the past decades, the findings suggest that several factors affecting the onset of civil wars also influence other forms of non-political violence such as social violence.

Putterman thereby identifies as a solution to the problem of democratic self-legislation what Rousseau sees as the most important danger to it. At issue is not merely the correct interpretation of Rousseau 's theory, for Putterman 's argument raises far-reaching questions concerning the compatibility of democratic principles and institutions. After demonstrating that Putterman is incorrect that the sovereign people in Rousseau's state delegate the power of legislative initiative, I examine how Rousseau anticipates and addresses a related question central to contemporary democratic and social choice theory: the problem of preference aggregation through voting in the absence of agenda-setting institutions.",2-s2.0-17044438284,5,2005,American Political Science Review,0

The current work demonstrates an important case in which consideration targets are resistant to particular inferences, which leads such inferences to be applied instead to one's environment. Specifically, when considering safety-oriented products, consumers exposed to unstable-looking brand logos infer the presence of unsafe conditions, and because safety-oriented products are resistant to inferences that they are unsafe, the inference is instead applied to the environment (i.e., ""the environment is unsafe""). This process subsequently increases the perceived utility of safety-oriented products. Five experiments collectively demonstrate the core effect, uncover the underlying inferential mechanism, and demonstrate the crucial role of inference resistance in the process. Overall, the present findings suggest that in some cases, a logo design that is opposed to desired product or brand beliefs may ironically help in boosting demand.",2-s2.0-84991038685,4,2016,Journal of Consumer Research,0

This paper studies the optimal level of discretion in policymaking. We consider a fiscal policy model where the government has time-inconsistent preferences with a present bias toward public spending. The government chooses a fiscal rule to trade offits desire to commit to not overspend against its desire to have flexibility to react to privately observed shocks to the value of spending. We analyze the optimal fiscal rule when the shocks are persistent. Unlike under independent and identically distributed shocks, we show that the ex ante optimal rule is not sequentially optimal, as it provides dynamic incentives. The ex ante optimal rule exhibits history dependence, with high shocks leading to an erosion of future fiscal discipline compared to low shocks, which lead to the reinstatement of discipline. The implied policy distortions oscillate over time given a sequence of high shocks, and can force the government to accumulate maximal debt and become immiserated in the long run.",2-s2.0-84908180987,2,2014,Econometrica,0
1234,64945,Smith D.T.,Predicting acceptance of mormons as christians by religion and party identity,"Predicting acceptance of mormons as christians by religion and party identity. During the 2012 election, Americans were evenly divided over the question of whether Mormonism - the religion of one of the candidates - could legitimately be called a Christian religion. This has potentially serious consequences in an electorate with a large Christian majority, and in a country where religious and national identities are closely associated. This paper uses a framework from social identity theory and data from the 2012 ANES Time Series to explain this divide in opinion, which went far beyond traditional evangelical hostility to Mormons and crossed party lines. Because of their theological heterodoxy and cultural difference, Mormons are less likely to be regarded as Christians by other Christians who identify very strongly with their faith. Prototype theory suggests these strong identifiers are more concerned with maintaining strict requirements for group membership, while weaker identifiers are more likely to accept Mormons as Christians. In the context of an election campaign with a Mormon candidate, however, party identity also matters. Christians who identify strongly with the Republican Party are, all things being equal, more likely than weaker party identifiers or Democrats to regard Mormons as Christians, because they want ""their"" candidate to be part of the religious in-group. All else being equal, voters who did not regard Mormons as Christians were 18 percent less likely to vote for Romney. However, the electoral damage to Romney was mitigated by Republican Party identification, which led many Christian voters to identify Mormons as Christians.",2-s2.0-84994756843,5,2016,Public Opinion Quarterly,0

This study evaluates the relationship between foreign direct investment (FDI) and interstate conflict, focusing on four prominent causal mechanisms: the declining benefits of territorial conquest, increasing preference similarity, increasing opportunity costs of violence, and improved information signaling. Empirical analyses show that new territorial issues are less likely to arise as global levels of FDI increase, although monadic and bilateral FDI flows have no effect on states' decisions to start new issue claims. Higher bilateral FDI flows between two disputants significantly reduce the chances for escalation to high levels of violence over issues and improve the chances for peaceful management. Increasing global levels of FDI also reduce the chances for severe militarized conflicts. Opportunity costs are an important mechanism linking FDI and states' conflict management practices, as the pacifying effect of bilateral and monadic FDI on militarized conflict becomes stronger in dyads with a history of militarization over the issues at stake.",2-s2.0-84864046525,5,2012,Journal of Conflict Resolution,0

Second, efficient coordination is achieved only if subgroups as well as individuals agree to cooperate. Even in situations in which there are gains to coordination, the agreement of each possible subgroup may be impossible to reach, resulting in instabilities.

Companies often collect data from these various platforms at differing levels of aggregation, and it is not clear how to merge these data sources to draw meaningful inferences about customer-level behavior patterns. In this article, the authors provide a method that firms can use, based on readily available data, to gauge and monitor multiplatform media usage. The key innovation in the method is a Bayesian data-fusion approach that enables researchers to combine individual-level usage data (readily available for most digital platforms) with aggregated data on usage over time (typically available for traditional platforms). This method enables the authors to disentangle the intraday correlations between platforms (i.e., the usage of one platform vs. another on a given day) from longer-term correlations across users (i.e., heavy/light usage of multiple platforms over time).

Those early experiments, the results of which too often are taken at face value, are reconsidered along with various later experiments that show conditioning, both of the CS and its context, in random training.

The goal is to put recent industrial policy debates into a somewhat wider perspective by developing a neglected argument about the design of industrial policy: that problems of technological stagnation are not always caused by the production of ""too few' innovations so much as they are caused by problems associated with a too limited use of innovations. It follows from this that policies applied to innovation producing industries (""horizontal strategies' hereafter) may not be as efficacious as those applied to upstream supplier or to downstream user industries (""vertical strategies' hereafter). We start by reviewing the classic arguments (and recent evidence) about market failure and R&D. We shall argue that our observations are consistent with a considerable body of empirical evidence about the determinants of successful innovations, and they imply that vertical strategies are often rather more attractive than horizontal ones for those interested in the design of policies to stimulate innovation.

There has been substantial interest in the social and health sciences in the reciprocal causal influences that people in close relationships have on one another. Most research has considered reciprocal processes involving only 2 units, although many social relationships of interest occur within a larger group (e.g., families, work groups, peer groups, classrooms). This article presents a general longitudinal multilevel modeling framework for the simultaneous estimation of reciprocal relationships among individuals with unique roles operating in a social group. We use family data for illustrative purposes, but the model is generalizable to any social group in which measurements of individuals in the social group occur over time, individuals have unique roles, and clustering of the data is evident. We allow for the possibility that the outcomes of family members are influenced by a common set of unmeasured family characteristics. The multilevel model we propose allows for residual variation in the outcomes of parents and children at the occasion, individual, and family levels and residual correlation between parents and children due to the unmeasured shared environment, genetic factors, and shared measurement. Another advantage of this method over approaches used in previous family research is it can handle mixed family sizes.

1251,52783,"Ansari A., Jedidi K., Jagpal S.",A hierarchical Bayesian methodology for treating heterogeneity in structural equation models,"A hierarchical Bayesian methodology for treating heterogeneity in structural equation models. Structural equation models are widely used in marketing and psychometric literature to model relationships between unobserved constructs and manifest variables and to control for measurement error. Most applications of structural equation models assume that data come from a homogeneous population. This assumption may be unrealistic, as individuals are likely to be heterogeneous in their perceptions and evaluations of unobserved constructs. In addition, individuals may exhibit different measurement reliabilities. It is well-known in statistical literature that failure to account for unobserved sources of individual differences can result in misleading inferences and incorrect conclusions. We develop a hierarchical Bayesian framework for modeling general forms of heterogeneity in partially recursive structural equation models. Our framework elucidates the motivations for accommodating heterogeneity and illustrates theoretically the types of misleading inferences that can result when unobserved heterogeneity is ignored. We describe in detail the choices that researchers can make in incorporating different forms of measurement and structural heterogeneity. Current random-coefficient models in psychometric literature can accommodate heterogeneity solely in mean structures. We extend these models by allowing for heterogeneity both in mean and covariance structures. Specifically, in addition to heterogeneity in measurement intercepts and factor means, we account for heterogeneity in factor covariance structure, measurement error, and structural parameters. Models such as random-coefficient factor analysis, random-coefficient second-order factor analysis, and random-coefficient, partially recursive simultaneous equation models are special cases of our proposed framework. We also develop Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) procedures to perform Bayesian inference in partially recursive, random-coefficient structural equation models. These procedures provide individual-specific estimates of the factor scores, structural coefficients, and other model parameters. We illustrate our approach using two applications. The first application illustrates our methods on synthetic data, whereas the second application uses consumer satisfaction data involving measurements on satisfaction, expectation disconfirmation, and performance variables obtained from a panel of subjects. Our results from the synthetic data application show that our Bayesian procedures perform well in recovering the true parameters. More importantly, we find that models that ignore heterogeneity can yield a severely distorted picture of the nature of associations among variables and can therefore generate misleading inferences. Specifically, we find that ignoring heterogeneity can result in inflated estimates of measurement reliability, wrong signs of factor covariances, and can yield attenuated model fit and standard errors. The results from the consumer satisfaction study show that individuals vary both in means and covariances and indicate that conventional psychometric methods are not appropriate for our data. In addition, we find that heterogeneous models outperform the standard structural equation model in predictive ability. Managerially, we show how one can use the individual-level factor scores and structural parameter estimates from the Bayesian approach to perform quadrant analysis and refine marketing policy (e.g., develop a one-on-one marketing policy). The framework introduced in this paper and the inference procedures we describe should be of interest to researchers in a wide range of disciplines in which measurement error and unobserved heterogeneity are problematic. In particular, our approach is suitable for studies in which panel data or multiple observations are available for a given set of respondents or objects (e.g., firms, organizations, markets). At a practical level, our procedures can be used by managers and other policymakers to customize marketing activities or policies. Future research should extend our procedures to deal with the general nonrecursive structural equation model and to handle binary and ordinal data situations.",2-s2.0-0034257394,4,2000,Marketing Science,0

Rationalizability is a central solution concept of game theory.

In this paper we try to achieve a general understanding of when this multiplicity occurs and how one should deal with it. Assuming that the set of possible payoff functions and belief structures is sufficiently rich, we establish a revealing structure of the correspondence of beliefs to sets of rationalizable outcomes. We show that, for any rationalizable action a of any type, we can perturb the beliefs of the type in such a way that a is uniquely rationalizable for the new type. This unique outcome will be robust to further small changes. When multiplicity occurs, then we are in a ""knife-edge"" case, where the unique rationalizable outcome changes, sandwiched between open sets of types where each of the rationalizable actions is uniquely rationalizable. As an immediate application of this result, we characterize, for any refinement of rationalizability, the predictions that are robust to small misspecifications of interim beliefs.

Having only risk-free debt confronts the Ramsey planner with additional constraints on equilibrium allocations beyond one imposed by Lucas and Stokey's assumption of complete markets. The Ramsey outcome blends features of Barro's model with Lucas and Stokey's. In our model, the contemporaneous effects of exogenous government expenditures on the government deficit and taxes resemble those in Lucas and Stokey's model, but incomplete markets put a near-unit root component into government debt and taxes, an outcome like Barro's.

1256,52780,"Häubl G., Trifts V.",Consumer decision making in online shopping environments: The effects of interactive decision aids,"Consumer decision making in online shopping environments: The effects of interactive decision aids. Despite the explosive growth of electronic commerce and the rapidly increasing number of consumers who use interactive media (such as the World Wide Web) for prepurchase information search and online shopping, very little is known about how consumers make purchase decisions in such settings. A unique characteristic of online shopping environments is that they allow vendors to create retail interfaces with highly interactive features. One desirable form of interactivity from a consumer perspective is the implementation of sophisticated tools to assist shoppers in their purchase decisions by customizing the electronic shopping environment to their individual preferences. The availability of such tools, which we refer to as interactive decision aids for consumers, may lead to a transformation of the way in which shoppers search for product information and make purchase decisions. The primary objective of this paper is to investigate the nature of the effects that interactive decision aids may have on consumer decision making in online shopping environments. While making purchase decisions, consumers are often unable to evaluate all available alternatives in great depth and, thus, tend to use two-stage processes to reach their decisions. At the first stage, consumers typically screen a large set of available products and identify a subset of the most promising alternatives. Subsequently, they evaluate the latter in more depth, perform relative comparisons across products on important attributes, and make a purchase decision. Given the different tasks to be performed in such a two-stage process, interactive tools that provide support to consumers in the following respects are particularly valuable: (1) the initial screening of available products to determine which ones are worth considering further, and (2) the in-depth comparison of selected products before making the actual purchase decision. This paper examines the effects of two decision aids, each designed to assist consumers in performing one of the above tasks, on purchase decision making in an online store. The first interactive tool, a recommendation agent (RA), allows consumers to more efficiently screen the (potentially very large) set of alternatives available in an online shopping environment. Based on self-explicated information about a consumer's own utility function (attribute importance weights and minimum acceptable attribute levels), the RA generates a personalized list of recommended alternatives. The second decision aid, a comparison matrix (CM), is designed to help consumers make in-depth comparisons among selected alternatives. The CM allows consumers to organize attribute information about multiple products in an alternatives X attributes matrix and to have alternatives sorted by any attribute. Based on theoretical and empirical work in marketing, judgment and decision making, psychology, and decision support systems, we develop a set of hypotheses pertaining to the effects of these two decision aids on various aspects of consumer decision making. In particular, we focus on how use of the RA and CM affects consumers' search for product information, the size and quality of their consideration sets, and the quality of their purchase decisions in an online shopping environment. A controlled experiment using a simulated online store was conducted to test the hypotheses. The results indicate that both interactive decision aids have a substantial impact on consumer decision making. As predicted, use of the RA reduces consumers' search effort for product information, decreases the size but increases the quality of their consideration sets, and improves the quality of their purchase decisions. Use of the CM also leads to a decrease in the size but an increase in the quality of consumers' consideration sets, and has a favorable effect on some indicators of decision quality. In sum, our findings suggest that interactive tools designed to assist consumers in the initial screening of available alternatives and to facilitate in-depth comparisons among selected alternatives in an online shopping environment may have strong favorable effects on both the quality and the efficiency of purchase decisions - shoppers can make much better decisions while expending substantially less effort. This suggests that interactive decision aids have the potential to drastically transform the way in which consumers search for product information and make purchase decisions.",2-s2.0-0034340397,4,2000,Marketing Science,0

In contrast, using a survey experiment, I show that cue and argument treatments only partially reduce the discrepancy between the views expressed by the public and the voting behavior of Congress on the same issues.

There are obvious economic predictors of ability and willingness to invest in environmental sustainability. Yet, given that environmental decisions represent trade-offs between present sacrifices and uncertain future benefits, psychological factors may also play a role in country-level environmental behavior. Gott's principle suggests that citizens may use perceptions of their country's age to predict its future continuation, with longer pasts predicting longer futures. Using country- and individual-level analyses, we examined whether longer perceived pasts result in longer perceived futures, which in turn motivate concern for continued environmental quality. Study 1 found that older countries scored higher on an environmental performance index, even when the analysis controlled for country-level differences in gross domestic product and governance. Study 2 showed that when the United States was framed as an old country (vs. a young one), participants were willing to donate more money to an environmental organization.

Change in group size and composition has long been an important area of research in the social sciences. Similarly, interest in interaction dynamics has a long history in sociology and social psychology. However, the effects of endogenous group change on interaction dynamics are a surprisingly understudied area. One way to explore these relationships is through social network models. Network dynamics may be viewed as a process of change in the edge structure of a network, in the vertex set on which edges are defined, or in both simultaneously. Although early studies of such processes were primarily descriptive, recent work on this topic has increasingly turned to formal statistical models. Although showing great promise, many of these modern dynamic models are computationally intensive and scale very poorly in the size of the network under study and/or the number of time points considered. Likewise, currently used models focus on edge dynamics, with little support for endogenously changing vertex sets. Here, the authors show how an existing approach based on logistic network regression can be extended to serve as a highly scalable framework for modeling large networks with dynamic vertex sets. The authors place this approach within a general dynamic exponential family (exponential-family random graph modeling) context, clarifying the assumptions underlying the framework (and providing a clear path for extensions), and they show how model assessment methods for cross-sectional networks can be extended to the dynamic case. Finally, the authors illustrate this approach on a classic data set involving interactions among windsurfers on a California beach.",2-s2.0-84927567931,7,2014,Sociological Methodology,0

This article presents a process-model for the abandonment of a practice. This complements earlier research on adoption and abandonment by allowing for fluctuations in the level of commitment across time and by demonstrating the persistent role for both institutional pressure and performance-based concerns on the maintenance of a practice. It also provides a novel means for identifying differences in the method of abandonment through the introduction of a concept of decommitment. Further, it helps resolve the question of how firms respond when faced with conflicting internal and external evidence of the success of an adopted practice. Using the divestiture of unrelated business segments by 100 U.S. firms between 1970–96, I estimate post-adoption commitment to a practice and the likelihood of a given firm decommitting. I find that treating abandonment as a process clarifies the evolving role of institutional and performance-based concerns and helps identify when a given firm is more subject to either source of pressure. The implications of this approach and these findings for current research on resistance to adoption and de-institutionalization are explored in the conclusion.",2-s2.0-84977100882,3,2016,Organization Studies,0

(2) While scholars are trained to search for generalizable patterns that hold both through time and across space and often seem to believe that the isolation of such associations is the sine qua non of the systematic analysis of international conflict, simple logic and already existing theory suggest that patterns of that variety may not in fact exist.

Social sharing of information goods-wherein a single good is purchased and shared through a network of acquaintances such as friends or coworkers-is a significant concern for the providers of these goods. The effect of social sharing on firm pricing and profits depends critically on two elements: the structure of the underlying consumer network and the mechanism used by groups to decide whether to purchase at a given price. We examine the effect of social sharing under different network structures (decentralized, centralized, and complete), which reflect a range of market conditions. Moreover, we draw from the mechanism design literature to examine several approaches to group decision making. Our results suggest that a firm can benefit from increased social sharing if the level of sharing is already high, enabling a pricing strategy targeted primarily at sharing groups rather than individuals. However, the point at which sharing becomes marginally beneficial for a firm depends on both the distribution of group sizes (which derives from the network structure) and the group decision mechanism. Additional insights are obtained when we extend the model to capture homophily in group formation and the potential that a subset of consumers will never share for ethical reasons.",2-s2.0-84864345266,4,2012,Marketing Science,0

Drawing on 23 months of participant observation and ethnographic research from 2006-2007 and 2009-2010 in four niche markets of Vietnam's global sex industry catering to Western budget tourists, Western transnational businessmen, Viet Kieu (overseas Vietnamese) men, and wealthy local Vietnamese entrepreneurs, I strategically bring together multiple performances of masculinities that simultaneously affirm and contest Western superiority. In lower-paying niche markets that cater to Western businessmen and Western budget travelers, sex bars provide men with the space to project their status anxieties onto women's bodies, affirming Western superiority. In contrast, more expensive bars catering to Viet Kieu and local elite Vietnamese businessmen provide men with the stage to contest Western superiority by capitalizing on this particular moment of economic flux and engaging in acts of conspicuous consumption to display their financial dominance. Together, these four niche markets of Vietnam's global sex industry provide a unique window to examine how multiple performances of masculinity unfold in relation to each other in the context of rapid economic change.",2-s2.0-84911911349,7,2014,Social Problems,0

In two studies, we presented stimuli inducing respiratory effort (respiratory loads) either organized into categories or located on a continuous dimension.

This work addresses a central question in both social problems theory and sociolegal studies: how can we understand and account for the content of legal categories that define social problems and attendant victims? It offers an empirical analysis of the emergence and evolution of federal hate crime laws - the Hate Crimes Statistics Act, the Violence Against Women Act, and the Hate Crimes Penalty Enhancement Act - that determine who is and is not eligible for hate crime victim status. By examining the legislative histories of these laws as evidence of ""critical discursive moments"" (Gamson 1992), I show how the substantive character of the law was shaped over time: I first establish a historical context for federal hate crime law; then I analyze how an important element hate crime law - the adoption of select status provisions, such as race, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender, and disabilities - unfolded such that some victims of discriminatory violence have been recognized as hate crime victims while others have gone unnoticed. In particular, people of color, Jews, gays and lesbians, women, and those with disabilities increasingly have been recognized as victims of hate crime, while union members, the elderly, children, and police officers, for example, have not. The findings suggest that the content of federal hate crime law was shaped by a series of temporally bound institutionally qualified processes whereby: 1) the empirical credibility of the scope of hate crime as a social problem was established by the claimsmaking of established social movement organizations; 2) a trio of core provisions for hate crime law - race, religion, and ethnicity - was cemented as the anchoring provisions of all hate crime law through discursive strategies that rendered particular types of violence empirically credible and worthy of federal attention; 3) the domain of the law expanded to include additional provisions, most notably sexual orientation and gender, in qualitatively distinct ways; and 4) the increased differentiation of legal subjects in subsequent law occurred in ways consistent with previously established and institutionalized policy pedigrees. Taken together, these findings reveal how microlevel processes of categorization work, mesolevel processes of social movement mobilization, and larger processes of institutionalization interface as political actors create and coalesce around legal meanings that define both ""condition-categories"" and ""people-categories"" (Loseke 1993).",2-s2.0-0033229346,7,1999,Social Problems,0

Perfect competition eliminates the need for lenders to compute how the size of their loan or the price they quote might affect default rates. It also makes for a simple equilibrium refinement, which we propose in order to rule out irrational pessimism about deliveries of untraded assets.

An accessible collectivist (vs. individualist) mind-set should heighten sensitivity to an emergent relationship among items chosen together so that having some is not acceptable if not all can be obtained. Indeed, we found that Latinos (but not Anglos) refuse chosen items if not all can be obtained (Study 1a). Further, making a collectivist mind-set accessible reproduces this between-groups difference (Study 1b), increases people's willingness to pay to complete sets (Study 1b), and shifts choice to previously undesired items if no set-completing option is provided (Studies 2-4). Finally, we found that increased sensitivity to an emergent relationship among chosen items mediates these effects (Studies 3 and 4).",2-s2.0-84883785724,6,2013,Psychological Science,0

When academic researchers participate in commercialization using for-profit firms, there is a potentially costly trade-off-their time and effort are diverted away from academic knowledge production. This is a form of brain drain on the not-for-profit research sector that may reduce knowledge accumulation and adversely impact long-run economic growth. In this paper, we examine the economic significance of the brain drain phenomenon using scientist-level panel data. We identify life scientists who start or join for-profit firms using information from the Small Business Innovation Research program and analyze the research performance of these scientists relative to a control group of randomly selected research peers. Combining our statistical results with data on the number of university spin-offs in the United States from 1994 to 2004, we find the academic brain drain has a nontrivial impact on knowledge production in the not-for-profit research sector.

We introduce and test two alternative growth principles: preferential acquisition - words enter the lexicon not because they are related to well-connected words, but because they connect well to other words in the learning environment - and the lure of the associates - new words are favored in proportion to their connections with known words. We tested these alternative principles using longitudinal analyses of developing networks of 130 nouns children learn prior to the age of 30 months. We tested both networks with links between words represented by features and networks with links represented by associations. The feature networks did not predict age of acquisition using any growth model.

Better investor protection implies better risk sharing. Because of entrepreneurs' risk aversion, this results in a larger demand for capital. This is the demand effect. A second effect (the supply effect) follows from general equilibrium restrictions. Better protection (i.e., higher demand) increases the interest rate and lowers the income of entrepreneurs, decreasing current savings and next period's supply of capital. The supply effect is stronger the tighter are the restrictions on capital flows. Our model thus predicts that the (positive) effect of investor protection on growth is stronger for countries with lower restrictions.

Noise in the decision stage necessitates a 2-criterion decision system, and over time the criteria converge until a decision is reached. Performance is predicted from the moments (expectation and variance) of the similarity distributions, and these can be derived from the theory.

Asymmetric information, the parameter that is frequently ignored in the literature, turns out to be an important welfare instrument for the hold-up problem.

Refining the affective-reactivity hypothesis of extraversion,"Do extraverts get more bang for the buck? Refining the affective-reactivity hypothesis of extraversion. One of the most robust observations in personality and emotion research is the finding that extraverts are happier than introverts. Some theorists have attributed this to differential reactivity of the brain reward system, which is central to many biologically inspired models of extraversion. This affective-reactivityhypothesis, which suggests that extraverts should be more susceptible to the induction of positive affect, has so far received very mixed empirical support. In this article, we consider a more biologically plausible account of extraverts' affective-reactivity. Over 5 experiments, we demonstrate that extraverts show greater affective-reactivity only in response to clearly appetitive stimuli and situations (e.g., where rewards are being pursued). Conversely, after merely pleasant stimuli and situations (without any reward-approach element), extraverts and introverts respond similarly. We also show that it is specifically activated affect (e.g., feelings of alertness), rather than pleasantly valenced affect (e.g., feelings of contentment), that characterizes the affective-reactivity of extraverts. Such reactions may potentially facilitate the reward-seeking behavior associated with extraversion, but they seem unlikely to explain the broadly happy disposition of extraverts.",2-s2.0-84871677865,6,2012,Journal of Personality and Social Psychology,0

I offer a general theory of political representation which explains representation simply by reference to a relevant audience accepting a person as such. When audiences use democratic rules of recognition, the familiar cases arise. When audiences use nondemocratic rules of recognition, nondemocratic cases arise.

This represents an important gap in the literature given the fundamental role of objectives in decision making and widespread evidence that many firms, especially those that are closely held, are motivated by nonfinancial objectives in addition to an interest in financial returns. To further our understanding of firms' competitive strategy decisions, we discuss how the presence of nonfinancial objectives in closely held firms leads to a weakening of the relationship between economic indications of profitability and competitive behaviors. Using a unique data set of nearly 4,000 closely held and non-closely held establishments engaged in local competition in the Texas hotel industry, we find that the entry, exit, and pricing decisions of closely held establishments are less responsive to economic indicators of profit potential compared with decisions of non-closely held establishments.",2-s2.0-84904915997,3,2014,Organization Science,0

In this paper, we provide efficient estimators and honest confidence bands for a variety of treatment effects including local average (LATE) and local quantile treatment effects (LQTE) in data-rich environments. We can handle very many control variables, endogenous receipt of treatment, heterogeneous treatment effects, and function-valued outcomes. Our framework covers the special case of exogenous receipt of treatment, either conditional on controls or unconditionally as in randomized control trials. In the latter case, our approach produces efficient estimators and honest bands for (functional) average treatment effects (ATE) and quantile treatment effects (QTE). To make informative inference possible, we assume that key reduced-form predictive relationships are approximately sparse. This assumption allows the use of regularization and selection methods to estimate those relations, and we provide methods for post-regularization and post-selection inference that are uniformly valid (honest) across a wide range of models. We show that a key ingredient enabling honest inference is the use of orthogonal or doubly robust moment conditions in estimating certain reduced-form functional parameters. We illustrate the use of the proposed methods with an application to estimating the effect of 401(k) eligibility and participation on accumulated assets. The results on program evaluation are obtained as a consequence of more general results on honest inference in a general moment-condition framework, which arises from structural equation models in econometrics. Here, too, the crucial ingredient is the use of orthogonal moment conditions, which can be constructed from the initial moment conditions. We provide results on honest inference for (function-valued) parameters within this general framework where any high-quality, machine learning methods (e.g., boosted trees, deep neural networks, random forest, and their aggregated and hybrid versions) can be used to learn the nonparametric/high-dimensional components of the model.

How should researchers treat questions of veracity when conducting interviews in settings rent by large-scale violence, such as war and genocide? To what extent should researchers trust narratives that are generated in politically sensitive contexts? The article argues that the value of narrative data does not lie solely in their truthfulness or accuracy; it also lies in the meta-data that accompany these testimonies. Meta-data are informants' spoken and unspoken thoughts and feelings which they do not always articulate in their stories or interview responses, but which emerge in other ways.

The article argues that meta-data are not extraneous to our datasets, they are data and should be viewed as integral to the processes of data collection and analysis. Meta-data indicate how conditions in the present shape what people are willing to say about violence in the past, what they have reason to embellish or minimize, and what they prefer to keep to themselves. Attending to meta-data is important for responding to informants' fears about talking to a researcher and to ensure informants' safety after the researcher leaves the field. It is also crucial for the robustness of researchers' theories and knowledge about political violence and other political phenomena.

Four studies evince that differences in hierarchical structure inherent in brands working with (i.e., partner brands) versus working for (i.e., servant brands) consumers engender materialism to play a systematic role in determining consumer responses to being an equal partner versus dominating master in consumer-brand relationships. In particular, materialists respond more favorably to a servant brand than to a partner brand when the brand is anthropomorphized (vs. objectified), and they respond more favorably to an anthropomorphized servant brand than do nonmaterialists. This effect is actualized through traits of materialists, moderated by brand status and mediated by an activated desire to dominate the servant brand.

Relative gains do impede cooperation in the two-actor case and provide an important justification for treating international anarchy as a prisoner's dilemma problem; but if the initial absolute gains situation is not a prisoner's dilemma, relative gains seeking is much less consequential. Its significance is even more attenuated with more than two competitors.

1328,80644,"Rogers T., Milkman K.L.",Reminders Through Association,"Reminders Through Association. People often fail to follow through on good intentions. While limited self-control is frequently the culprit, another cause is simply forgetting to enact intentions when opportunities arise. We introduce a novel, potent approach to facilitating follow-through: the reminders-through-association approach. This approach involves associating intentions (e.g., to mail a letter on your desk tomorrow) with distinctive cues that will capture attention when you have opportunities to act on those intentions (e.g., Valentine’s Day flowers that arrived late yesterday, which are sitting on your desk). We showed that cue-based reminders are more potent when the cues they employ are distinctive relative to (a) other regularly encountered stimuli and (b) other stimuli encountered concurrently. Further, they can be more effective than written or electronic reminder messages, and they are undervalued and underused. The reminders-through-association approach, developed by integrating and expanding on past research on self-control, reminders, and prospective memory, can be a powerful tool for policymakers and individuals.",2-s2.0-84978516990,6,2016,Psychological Science,0

This article provides a formal mathematical treatment of the link between competitive advantage and risk in strategic interaction. In the first part of the analysis, I establish a basic mechanism whereby a rational, profit-maximizing firm that is risk neutral with respect to realized profits would nonetheless benefit from risk in the antecedent process of developing a competitive advantage. This result serves to motivate two game-theoretic models demonstrating that (1) the trade-off between risk and expectation in developing a competitive advantage and (2) the shape of this risk each define a different and previously unexplored dimension of differentiation along which firms choose distinctive competitive positions. Two other important aspects of market rivalry-the number of competing firms and their product market overlap-affect where firms position themselves and which firms have higher expected profit than others. The analysis offers a risk-based theory of the origins of competitive advantage among initially identical rival firms and sheds light on the empirical evidence regarding both the relationship between risk and profitability and the performance implications of corporate social responsibility.",2-s2.0-84898955819,3,2014,Academy of Management Review,0

Independent candidates are widely believed to influence the quality of representation through issues as fundamental to democracy as government accountability, responsiveness, and electoral turnout. Their impact, however, hinges on their electoral strength, which varies widely within and across countries. In order to explain this variation, this study examines which aspects of electoral systems affect independents the most and why. Based on a statistical analysis of 34 countries around the world between 1945 and 2003, this study finds that electoral systems influence the electoral strength of independent candidates by defining the opportunities for independents to compete for office (i.e., ballot access requirements), the degree to which politics is candidate centered versus partisan driven (i.e., majority/plurality rule, district magnitude, open-list PR, and democratic transitions), and the extent to which small vote getters win seats (i.e., district size and electoral thresholds).

Fertility transition patterns are also supplied, including a regional overview for Latin America, east and Southeast Asia, South Asia, West Asia and North Africa, and sub-Saharan Africa. The specialized cases of China, India, Bangladesh, Thailand and Indonesia, and Brazil are also presented. The fertility determinant models of Bongaarts, Davis and Blake, Hobcraft and Little, Ryder, and Henry are used as examples of proximate determinant models. Data collection was possible on a grand scale with contraceptive knowledge, attitudes, and practice (KAP) surveys and the World Fertility Surveys and Demographic and Health Surveys. Criticism has focused on the scope of these surveys which provide at best proximate determinants and differentiate fertility by standard socioeconomic factors. Data are also obtained on small populations from piecing together records and from quasi-anthropological fieldwork. Historical demography relies on family reconstitution. Longitudinal studies are few in number. The largest and most effective fieldwork station is at Matlab in Bangladesh. Caldwell has provided anthropological methods applicable to fertility study and makes use of teamwork. In Latin America, fertility has fallen by 40% since the 1960s. Bolivia, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Haiti have changed very little. Taiwan and South Korea provide examples of economic growth with equity in East and Southeast Asia.

Digit-based election forensics (DBEF) typically relies on null hypothesis significance testing, with undesirable effects on substantive conclusions. This article proposes an alternative free of this problem. It rests on decomposing the observed numeral distribution into the ""no fraud"" and ""fraud"" latent classes, by finding the smallest fraction of numerals that needs to be either removed or reallocated to achieve a perfect fit of the ""no fraud"" model. The size of this fraction can be interpreted as a measure of fraudulence. Both alternatives are special cases of measures of model fit-the π*mixture index of fit and the δ dissimilarity index, respectively. Furthermore, independently of the latent class framework, the distributional assumptions of DBEF can be relaxed in some contexts. Independently or jointly, the latent class framework and the relaxed distributional assumptions allow us to dissect the observed distributions using models more flexible than those of existing DBEF.

By comparison, data on political contributions by individual capitalists were, until recently, difficult to obtain and rarely subjected to systematic study. Important differences are demonstrated between these two forms of capitalist political action by directly comparing the campaign contributions of 592 individual capitalists with the contributions of the 394 major corporations with which those capitalists were associated. Campaign contributions by individual capitalists follow a logic different from that of corporate PACs. Corporations are generally more interested in buying influence with incumbents, while individual capitalists are more concerned with bolstering the election prospects of favored candidates. By providing a more direct measure of capitalists'political preferences, the analysis of campaign contributions by individual capitalists clarifies theoretical questions that remain unresolved in the research based on corporate PACs.

While it is difficult to unite individuals in a common endeavor, some people, who we call ''movers and shakers,'' seem able to do it. The article specifically examines moving and shaking of an investment project, whose return depends on its quality and the total capital invested in it. We analyze a model with two types of agents: managers and investors. Managers and investors initially form social connections. Managers then bid to buy control of the project, and the winning bidder puts effort into making investors aware of it. Finally, a subset of aware investors are given the chance to invest and they decide whether to do so after receiving private signals of the project's quality. We first show that connections are valuable since they make it easier for a manager to ''move and shake'' the project (i.e., obtain capital from investors). When we endogenize the network, we find that while managers are identical ex ante, a single manager emerges as most connected; he consequently earns a rent. In extensions, we move away from the assumption of ex ante identical managers to highlight forces that lead one manager or another to become a mover and shaker. Our theory sheds light on a range of topics, including entrepreneurship, venture capital, and anchor investments.

On Paul Weithman's influential interpretation, Rawls attempts to solve this problem by claiming that public reason is an assurance mechanism. There are several problems with Rawls's solution: Public reason talk is too cheap to facilitate assurance, it is difficult to know when particular utterances express public reasons, and the requirements of public reason conflict with the fact of reasonable pluralism. We argue that convergence discourse - not public reason - solves the assurance problem by being a costly signal that indicates commitment to the political conception. This solution has none of Rawls's problems and has an interesting corollary: As diversity increases in society, so too does society's ability to solve the assurance problem.

We find that discretionary separation pay is given to about 40% of departing CEOs and is, on average, $8 million, which amounts to close to 242% of a CEO's annual compensation. We investigate the determinants of discretionary separation pay and find, for example, that discretionary separation pay positively correlates with weak internal governance in cases of voluntary CEO turnover but not when the CEO is forced out. We also find that discretionary pay is higher when the CEO has a noncompete clause in her ex ante severance contract.

In all cases, the key to sanctions success is to generate political costs for the target regime's winning coalition. However, because of different institutional incentives, economically punishing sanctions are less likely to succeed against a nondemocratic target than against a democratic target. Sanctions increase rents. This benefits nondemocratic leaders more than democratic ones. Also, nondemocratic leaders have smaller winning coalitions, so their core constituents suffer less from sanctions than democratic leaders. Additionally, the authors' strategic argument leads to novel hypotheses regarding the initiation of sanctions.

In a survey-based simulation of these studies, students allocated one of three lotteries to their blood relatives. As expected, participants allocated greater proportions of their lotteries to relatives of greater genetic relatedness. This effect became stronger with decreasing lottery amounts. Relatives of certain relatedness were favored over relatives of uncertain relatedness (via paternal uncertainty), and this effect was stronger among those with less money to allocate. Male participants tended to favor their young female relatives over their young male relatives when given the smallest lottery, but this sex preference reversed when male participants were given the largest lottery.

The objective of this paper is to analytically examine how the competitive strategy and profitability of firms are affected by the presence of consumer loss aversion in the price dimension. Although we assume that consumer loss aversion increases consumer propensity to search for lower prices, we find that it does not necessarily lead to lower prices or profits when firms compete over multiple periods and when the consumer reference price in subsequent periods is affected by current prices. Specifically, consumer loss aversion could lead to higher prices and profits when consumer valuation is sufficiently high relative to search costs and the proportion of consumers with positive search costs is in an intermediate range.

This paper proposes a release-based approach that uses revised data of all observations to estimate DSGE models, but the model is still helpful for real-time forecasting. This new approach accounts for data uncertainty when predicting future values of macroeconomic variables subject to revisions, thus providing policy-makers and professional forecasters with both backcasts and forecasts. Application of this new approach to a medium-sized DSGE model improves the accuracy of density forecasts, particularly the coverage of predictive intervals, of US real macro variables.

Numerous emotion researchers have asked their study participants to attend to the distinct feelings of arousal and valence, and self-report and physiological data have supported the independence of the two. We examined whether this dissociation reflects introspection about distinct emotional qualia or the way in which valence is measured. With either valence (Experiment 1) or arousal (Experiment 2) as the primary focus, when valence was measured using a bipolar scale (ranging from negative to positive), it was largely dissociable from arousal. By contrast, when two separate unipolar scales of pleasant and unpleasant valence were used, their sum was equivalent to feelings of arousal and its autonomic correlates. The association (or dissociation) of valence and arousal was related to the estimation (or nonestimation) of mixed-valence experiences, which suggests that the distinction between valence and arousal may reflect less the nature of emotional experience and more how it is measured. These findings further encourage use of unipolar valence scales in psychological measurement.",2-s2.0-84881256248,6,2013,Psychological Science,0

Recent research has shown that two entropy-based segregation indices possess an appealing mixture of basic and subsidiary but useful properties. It would appear that the only fundamental difference between the mutual information or M index, and the entropy information or H index, is that the second is a normalized version of the first. This paper introduces another normalized index in that family, the H* index, which captures segregation as the tendency of racial groups to have different distributions across schools. More importantly, the paper shows that applied researchers may do better using the M index than using either H or H* in two circumstances: (1) if they are interested in the decomposability of the measurement of segregation, and (2) if they are interested in a margin-free measurement of segregation changes. The shortcomings of the H and H* indices are illustrated below by means of numerical examples, as well as with school segregation data by ethnic group in the U.S. public school system between 1989 and 2005.",2-s2.0-80855131494,7,2011,Sociological Methodology,0

A traditional argument against a balanced-budget fiscal policy rule is that it amplifies business cycles by stimulating aggregate demand during booms via tax cuts and higher public expenditures and by reducing demand during recessions through a corresponding fiscal contraction. This paper suggests an additional source of instability that may arise from this type of fiscal policy rule. It shows that, within the standard neoclassical growth model, a balanced-budget rule can make expectations of higher tax rates self-fulfilling if the fiscal authority relies heavily on changes in labor income taxes to eliminate short-run fiscal imbalances. Calibrated versions of the model show that indeterminacy occurs for income tax rates that are empirically plausible for the U.S. economy and other Group of Seven countries.",2-s2.0-0001318921,2,1997,Journal of Political Economy,0

Consistent with expectations, opportunities in manufacturing drew students from primary school before World War II, while expansions in the government sector increased the likelihood of drop-out at the secondary and tertiary levels after the war. In this later period, students from the lower and middle classes often were more likely to have school because of economic expansion.

A coupon is a commonly used sales promotion device offering the user a discount on the purchase of a product. Consumer coupon offerings are also becoming increasingly diverse: from ""% off"" and ""$ off"" to ""Buy one, Get one free"" (BOGO) offers and co-promotions (Buy X, Deal on Y). This paper reports the results of three experiments that examine whether the economic value of a coupon is a source of information to infer the price of the product/service, and the quality of the product/service, which inference can undercut the economic value, with resulting consequences for deal evaluations and purchase intentions. The framework predicts, and empirical results show, that increasing the value of the coupon does not always improve deal evaluations or purchase intentions. This could imply lower profits for the company. The presence of past price information about the brand, information about prices of other brands offered by the company, and information about competitors' prices moderate the impact of coupon value on brand-related inferences. When such alternate sources of information are present and are diagnostic of the price of the promoted product, consumers are less likely to infer price and quality from the value of the coupon and higher coupon values are more likely to increase deal evaluations and purchase intentions. Implications for managers designing and communicating promotions are offered.",2-s2.0-1642419170,4,2004,Journal of Retailing,0

Testing these hypotheses is fraught with methodological challenges; to overcome them, we study the deportation of Crimean Tatars in 1944 and the indiscriminate way deportees died from starvation and disease. We conducted a multigenerational survey of Crimean Tatars in 2014 and find that the descendants of individuals who suffered more intensely identify more strongly with their ethnic group, support more strongly the Crimean Tatar political leadership, hold more hostile attitudes toward Russia, and participate more in politics. But we find that victimization has no lasting effect on religious radicalization.

We examine the optimal monetary policy under commitment, focusing on the nature of price adjustment in determining policy. We investigate the implications of these policies for exchange-rate flexibility. The traditional approach maintains that exchange-rate flexibility is desirable in the presence of real country-specific shocks that require adjustment in relative prices. However, in the light of empirical evidence on nominal price response to exchange-rate changes-specifically, that there appears to be a large degree of local-currency pricing (LCP) in industrialized countries-the expenditure-switching role played by nominal exchange rates may be exaggerated in the traditional literature. In the presence of LCP, we find that the optimal monetary policy leads to a fixed exchange rate, even in the presence of country-specific shocks.

The Esquipulas peace process in Central America is examined as process, structure and context. It is found to be an innovative effort in regional conflict resolution. The study focuses on how mediation has been used in conflict management within Nicaragua. Trust- or confianza-based mediation has assumed special importance in the Nicaraguan case. The emphasis on the confianza relationship in Central American societies produces a type of mediator known as the insider-partial, who emerges from within the conflict situation itself. It differs markedly from the outsider-neutral third party common to post-industrial society. Its legitimacy and effectiveness come from the continuing personal connection of the mediator with the conflict parties before, during and after the intervention. The conflict between the Sandinista government and Atlantic Coast Indian leaders is analyzed to illustrate the use of confianza-based mediation and its effectiveness when combined with intervention by outsider-neutrals. The authors recommend a broadening of the concept of mediation to include intervention by insider-partials. Their continuity within and knowledge of the conflict situation effectively complement the outsider-neutrals' objectivity and lack of connection with conflictants. Mediator teams should be carefully selected to include both types, particularly for interventions in the developing world. It is recommended, additionally, that mediators attend more to modifying the mediation context to render it more supportive of their interventions. The authors conclude that Esquipulas represents a rich store of mediation experience for conflict research.",2-s2.0-84928439676,5,1991,Journal of Peace Research,0

This hypothesis is tested with longitudinal data for a national sample of suburbs for the period 1970 to 1990.

As predicted by theory, these effects are weaker for larger firms, which can more easily raise funds outside of the local area. These effects are present even when we instrument our indicator with the structure of the local banking markets in 1936, which, because of regulatory reasons, affected the supply of credit in the following 50 years.

Three potential explanations drawn from the literature on state formation are evaluated in explaining the outcome: the foreign intervention thesis blames the failure on the asymmetry of power between Israel and the PLO; the domestic structural claim is that the weakness of the legal system stems from the unwillingness of the ruler to limit his power; and the cultural argument claims that only Anglo-Saxon and European states are truly liberal and democratic. The findings show that the quest for power led to centralization of authority in the executive, despite valiant attempts by politicians and civil society to avert such an outcome, and the article identifies the types of obstacles that need to be overcome to transform the Palestinian entity into a democratic reality that would promote peaceful coexistence with its neighbors.",2-s2.0-34247185287,5,2007,Journal of Peace Research,0

Under certain conditions, the controlled direct effect enables researchers to rule out competing explanations - an important objective for political scientists. To estimate the controlled direct effect without bias, we describe an easy-to-implement estimation strategy from the biostatistics literature.

Studying the operational motivation of a retailer to publicly announce his forecast information, this paper shows that by making forecast information publicly available to both his manufacturer and to the competitor, a retailer is able to credibly share his forecast informationan outcome that cannot be achieved by merely exchanging information within the supply chain. We model a market comprised of an incumbent supply chain facing the possible entry of a competing supply chain. In each supply chain, a retailer sources the product from a manufacturer, and the manufacturers must secure capacity prior to the beginning of the selling season. Due to the superior knowledge of the incumbent retailer about the consumer market, he privately observes a signal about the consumer's demand, which may be high or low. We first confirm that the retailer cannot credibly share this forecast information only with his manufacturer within the supply chain, since, regardless of the observed signal, the retailer has an incentive to inflate to induce the manufacturer to secure a high capacity level. However, when the information is also shared with the competitor, the incumbent retailer faces the trade-off between the desire to secure an ample capacity level and the fear of intense competition. By making information publicly available, it is possible to achieve truthful information sharing; an incumbent retailer observing a high forecast benefits from the increased capacity level to such an extent that he is willing to engage in intense competition to prove his accountability for the shared information. On the other hand, an incumbent retailer with a low forecast is not willing to engage in intense competition in exchange for the high level of capacity; thus, he truthfully reveals his low forecast to weaken competition. Moreover, we demonstrate that this public information sharing can benefit all the firms in the market as well as consumers. In addition, we show that compared to the advance purchase contract, all the firms except the incumbent manufacturer can be better off using public information sharing under a simple wholesale price contract.",2-s2.0-84991662068,3,2016,Management Science,0

We investigate these relationships using data from 306 retail stores within a single retail chain.",2-s2.0-77949656150,4,2010,Journal of Retailing,0

Drawing from close to four years of ethnographic fieldwork, in-depth interviews, and video recordings, this paper analyzes how inner-city men sustain playful street corner rap ""battles"" in South Central Los Angeles. Although participants know that the battle is supposed to be a playful way of resolving perceived disrespect in group rap ""ciphers,"" some become ""more than play."" Indeed, ritual insults have the power to provoke feelings of rage, which can propel individuals into violence. To sustain the playful meanings of battles, participants who offend their opponent use different nonverbal cues to signal, ""I was just playing,"" while the offended party responds with cues signaling, ""I do not have any hard feelings."" When these moves do not work, onlookers step in between participants, tell jokes, and use other gestures to defuse escalating tensions. The techniques outlined in this article elaborate Erving Goffman's (1974) theories of ""keys"" and ""limits,"" showing how embodied and emotional cues are used to sustain the shared presumption that ""this is play.""",2-s2.0-68049131616,7,2009,Social Problems,0

In this study, I report the results of six experiments in question form conducted on a 1997 nationwide survey of 1,986 adult (age 18+) Kazakhstanis, 47 percent of whom are Kazakh and 34 percent of whom are Russian. Acquiescence bias is found among the entire sample, but it is stronger for ethnic Kazakhs than for ethnic Russians. Acquiescence bias is thus a problem of both question format and individual proclivities. Attitude statements with agree-disagree response sets are less valid measures of public attitudes than balanced questions with forced-choice response alternatives, and their use could cause erroneous inferences about ethnic differences in attitudes.",2-s2.0-0033243545,5,1999,Public Opinion Quarterly,0

In doing so, we stress a social constructivist approach to race mixture with a focus on boundary crossing. Finally, we also demonstrate how ideologies and practices of race mixture play out quite differently in contexts outside of the United States, particularly in Latin America. Race-mixture ideologies and practices in Latin America have been used to maintain racial inequality in the region, thus challenging recent arguments by U.S. scholars that greater racial mixture leads to a decline in racism, discrimination, and inequality.

Mobilization of resources is a central concern among analysts of social movements. However, little research has focused on factors that influence the types and amounts of resources collective actors are able to mobilize. In this study, data from local social movement organizations opposing drinking and driving are used to assess the roles of agency (i.e., amount of effort), strategy, organizational structure, and nature of national affiliation in the mobilization of resources. Measures of agency consistently predict mobilization of volunteer labor, revenue, and membership. Strategy seems less important: An emphasis on victim services was positively related only to mobilization of members. Organizational structure, particularly the number of task committees, was consistently related to mobilization of volunteer labor, revenue, and membership. Affiliation with a highly visible and highly legitimated national organization, Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD), appears to have an energizing effect on local leaders while it dampens the effects of agency, strategy, and organizational structure.

A model in which localized industry-specific spillovers, natural advantages, and pure random chance all contribute to geographic concentration is used to develop a test for whether observed levels of concentration are greater than would be expected to arise randomly and to motivate new indices of geographic concentration and of coagglomeration. The proposed indices control for differences in the size distribution of plants and for differences in the size of the geographic areas for which data are available. As a consequence, comparisons of the degree of geographic concentration across industries can be made with more confidence. Our empirical results provide a strong reaffirmation of the previous wisdom in that we find almost all industries to be somewhat localized. In many industries, however, the degree of localization is slight. We explore the nature of agglomerative forces in describing patterns of concentration, the geographic scope of localization, and the coagglomeration of related industries and of industries with strong upstream-downstream ties.",2-s2.0-0031418604,2,1997,Journal of Political Economy,0

Drawing on two years of fieldwork with the Metropolitan Nashville Police Department, it offers an extended ethnographic look at policing dilemmas in the era of immigration control. As the findings reveal, police bureaucracies respond to immigrant residents in contradictory ways. On one hand, the department has an official community policing program to increase trust and communication with Latino immigrant residents. On the other hand, street-level patrol officers undermine these efforts by citing and arresting Latino residents who lack state-issued ID. Thus, alongside ostensibly sincere efforts to incorporate immigrant residents, ultimately, police produce a form of social control and urban discipline through their discretionary decisions.",2-s2.0-84995559779,7,2016,Social Problems,0

Evidence on the Gender Pay Gap from Multifactorial Survey Experiments. Gender pay gaps likely persist in Western societies because both men and women consider somewhat lower earnings for female employees than for otherwise similar male employees to be fair. Two different theoretical approaches explain “legitimate” wage gaps: same-gender referent theory and reward expectations theory. The first approach states that women compare their lower earnings primarily with that of other underpaid women; the second approach argues that both men and women value gender as a status variable that yields lower expectations about how much each gender should be paid for otherwise equal work. This article is the first to analyze hypotheses contrasting the two theories using an experimental factorial survey design. In 2009, approximately 1,600 German residents rated more than 26,000 descriptions of fictitious employees. The labor market characteristics of each employee and the amount of information given about them were experimentally varied across all descriptions. The results primarily support reward expectations theory. Both men and women produced gender pay gaps in their fairness ratings (with the mean ratio of just female-to-male wages being.92). Respondents framed the just pay ratios by the gender inequalities they experienced in their own occupations, and some evidence of gender-specific evaluation standards emerged.",2-s2.0-85011629108,7,2017,American Sociological Review,0

As opposed to the estimator most frequently used in marketing studies, which drops the first choice of each panelist, this estimator keeps that choice in the estimation sample but ignores the impact of pre-sample choices on first observed choice. The proposed method presents major advantages over dropping the first observation: (1) it yields low bias estimates for state dependence coefficients and, thus, it can be used to assess the presence and the magnitude of state dependence; (2) it is informative about the magnitude of bias in its estimates; and (3) it yields substantially and significantly smaller biases.

Suggesting a cost to these reactions, actors' beliefs about having expressed heightened sensitivity, in turn, predicted their doubts about the authenticity of partners' positive feedback in the domain of contingency, independently of whether partners claimed to deliver inauthentic feedback. Suggesting a cost for partners, partners of contingent actors appeared to detect actors' expressions of sensitivity in the domain of contingency and respond by delivering inauthentic feedback to actors in the domain, which in turn predicted partners' increased relationship anxiety and decreased satisfaction.

The effect, which we refer to as ""the favor request effect"", is found across multiple shopping contexts and multiple types of favor requests (experiment 1) and in negotiations involving financial consequences (experiment 2).

Accordingly, we find that preschoolers (3–5.5 years old) rated crackers as less tasty and consumed fewer of them when the crackers were presented as instrumental to achieving a health goal (studies 1–2). In addition, preschoolers consumed fewer carrots and crackers when these were presented as instrumental to knowing how to read (study 3) and to count (studies 4–5).

In contrast, this article focuses on the problem of determining profit-improving store-level prices of failure-related ""hard-part"" product categories at a U.S. specialty automotive part retailer with 3400 stores. There are some key institutional differences between automotive hard-part and grocery retailing: No syndicated data are available for hard parts; each subclass of a hard-part category contains variants that are ordered by quality (typically ""Good,"" ""Better,"" ""Best""); there is intra- but no intersubclass competition; market shares of variants and their prices are not positively correlated within a subclass; a consumer enters the market only infrequently; and at a purchase occasion, a consumer buys one and only one variant within a subclass and one and only one unit of that variant. Using two years of weekly sales histories from 800 stores, the authors develop store-level demand models for 23 subclasses of a hard part and employ these with available product cost data to set prices of variants of each subclass at each store that increase profit. The authors test the model-recommended prices for 10 subclasses in a field experiment involving 500 stores, leading to a projection of an annual increase of more than $610,000 in the retailer's profit from these 10 subclasses if the new prices are applied at all stores.

1427,77306,Weiner I.,Neural substrates of latent inhibition: The switching model,"Neural substrates of latent inhibition: The switching model. Latent inhibition (LI) refers to decrement in conditioning to a stimulus as a result of its prior nonreinforced preexposure. It is a robust phenomenon that has been demonstrated in a variety of classical and instrumental conditioning procedures and in many mammalian species, including humans. The development of LI is considered to reflect decreased associability of, or attention to, stimuli that predict no significant outcome. The fact that LI is considered to be a reflection of attentional processes has become of increasing importance to neuroscientists who see LI as a convenient tool for measuring the effects of drug treatments and lesions on attention. The present article surveys the data on brain systems, which have been studied in regard to their involvement in LI. These are reviewed and discussed separately in sections on noradrenergic, cholinergic, dopaminergic, serotonergic, and septo-hippocampal manipulations. On the basis of these data, it is concluded that the neural substrates of LI include the mesolimbic dopaminergic system, the mesolimbic serotonergic system, and the hippocampus. It is proposed that the preexposed stimulus loses its capacity to affect behavior in conditioning, even though it predicts reinforcement, because the hippocampus inhibits the switching mechanism of the nucleus accumbens via the subiculum-accumbens pathway. This action of the hippocampus is modulated by the mesolimbic serotonergic system via its interactions with the hippocampal or mesolimbic dopaminergic systems, or both.",2-s2.0-0025520950,6,1990,Psychological Bulletin,0

Philosophers, historians, and social scientists have noted that people's moral boundaries have expanded over the last few centuries, but the notion of moral expansiveness has received limited empirical attention in psychology. This research explores variations in the size of individuals' moral boundaries using the psychological construct of moral expansiveness and introduces the Moral Expansiveness Scale (MES), designed to capture this variation. Across 6 studies, we established the reliability, convergent validity, and predictive validity of the MES. Moral expansiveness was related (but not reducible) to existing moral constructs (moral foundations, moral identity, ""moral"" universalism values), predictors of moral standing (moral patiency and warmth), and other constructs associated with concern for others (empathy, identification with humanity, connectedness to nature, and social responsibility). Importantly, the MES uniquely predicted willingness to engage in prosocial intentions and behaviors at personal cost independently of these established constructs. Specifically, the MES uniquely predicted willingness to prioritize humanitarian and environmental concerns over personal and national self-interest, willingness to sacrifice one's life to save others (ranging from human out-groups to animals and plants), and volunteering behavior. Results demonstrate that moral expansiveness is a distinct and important factor in understanding moral judgments and their consequences.

The ""intangible"" nature of e-commerce may cause shoppers to be uncertain about whether products ordered online will fit their needs or perform up to expectations. Such uncertainty is a dimension of consumer risk, or feelings that result because the actual outcome of a purchase decision can only be known in the future. However, the ability of e-retailers to offer a plethora of product-related information can ameliorate this uncertainty. This research assesses the influence of three online retailer communication practices-evoking vividness through pictures, allowing consumers to control information presentation, and presenting information from third-party sources. We demonstrate that these practices materially affect consumer perceptions of product performance uncertainty. Importantly, we also find that the influence of the practices differs by the search or experience orientation of the product, sometimes in counterintuitive ways. These results can serve to help enhance the effectiveness of e-retailers' communications and, in the case of multichannel retailers, help determine which products are best suited for different channels.",2-s2.0-36348975780,4,2007,Journal of Retailing,0

The authors investigate the memorial consequences of deliberately omitting crucial elements from an advertisement. Research on the self-generation effect in cognitive psychology indicates that such element omission may actually lead to an improvement in recall. Support for this perspective is obtained in a series of experiments that explores the effects of feature omission in the context of both overt omission (in which the omission is highlighted by the advertiser) and implicit omission (in which the omission, though not highlighted in the advertisement, is noticed because of prior expectations for that ad type). Even under highly constrained processing conditions (e.g., exposure times as short as four seconds), an advertisement that omits a key element is shown to produce better recall than an equivalent advertisement that contains the element. The authors find that this recall improvement occurs along dimensions that are specifically related to the omitted element; therefore, leaving out an element related only to the product category (but not the brand) produces an improvement only in category recall, whereas brand recall is improved by the omission of an element related to the brand name. The authors discuss theoretical and managerial implications of these findings.",2-s2.0-0035995541,4,2002,Journal of Marketing Research,0

There is no initial revenue, and cumulative revenue cannot decrease. Revenues from innovations are characterized by different lives and different rates of the resolution of uncertainty. A common deterministic model for predicting revenue from an innovation is known as the Bass model. We embed the Bass model in a gamma process, resulting in a stochastic process with moments proportional to the mean of the Bass model. To illustrate this model we choose the valuation of options on movie box office revenue. These options enable film distributors to manage the risk of a movie, and they offer diversification opportunities for investors.

It suggests that coor dination and legitimacy problems can be particular threats to the survival of some intermediate organizational forms. Drawing on historical and archival materials, the paper chronicles the collapse of the Suzuki zaibatsu, a business empire with sales that at one point equalled 10 percent of Japan's GNP. Suzuki's coordination problems and resource misallocations were the outcome of three factors: (a) the lack of mechanisms to coordinate relations between operating units and the holding company, (b) the failure of the ‘owners’, in this case a merchant family, to correct managerial inadequacies and, (c) the parallel failure of the group's ‘organ bank’ to discipline managers. Suzuki's legitimacy problems included a shortage of support from political parties, the bureaucracy and the media. This jeopardized Suzuki's ability to compete with other zaibatsu for public resources and gain institutional support that might have allowed survival. The implications of the case study for future research on the ‘failure’ of intermediate organizational forms are discussed.",2-s2.0-21844514178,3,1995,Organization Studies,0

Some participants predicted whether the dot would appear before seeing the outcome, whereas other participants were required to respond quickly if the dot appeared shortly after the display. In the prediction task, instructions guiding participants to infer which objects caused the dot to appear were necessary in order for contingencies associated with one object to influence participants' predictions about the object with which it had been paired. In the response task, contingencies associated with one object affected responses to its pair mate irrespective of whether or not participants were given causal instructions.

We first define a natural order on such strategies that disregards isolated disturbances, by using the limit of time-average payoffs. This order allows us to consider one strategy as strictly better than another in some population of strategies. We then determine a strategy σ to be ''robust,'' if in any population consisting of copies of two types of strategies, σ itself and some other strategy τ, the strategy σ is never worse than τ. We present a large class of such robust strategies. Strikingly, robustness can accommodate an arbitrary level of generosity, conditional on the strength of subsequent retaliation; and it does not require symmetric retaliation. Taken together, these findings allow us to design strategies that significantly lessen the problem of noise, without forsaking performance.

Tests of statistical equivalence are needed. This article corrects the inferential confidence interval (ICI) reduction factor introduced by W. W.

The ICI method provides an intuitive graphic method for inferring statistical difference as well as equivalence.

Within-dyad similarity was statistically significant on 86% of variables measured.

There were no effects on similarity of closeness, relationship length, or discussion of the attitude.

Theories of stratification and selection created doubts about whether education actually caused good things to happen. Because schools and colleges select who continues and who does not, it was easy to imagine that education added little of substance. Evidence now tips the balance away from bias and selection and in favor of substance. Investments in education pay off for individuals in many ways. The size of the direct effect of education varies among individuals and demographic groups. Education affects individuals and groups who are less likely to pursue a college education more than traditional college students. A smaller literature on social returns to education indicates that communities, states, and nations also benefit from increased education of their populations; some estimates imply that the social returns exceed the private returns.

A new approach to identifying class structure. If class theory has explanatory and descriptive power it should be possible to provide evidence that social classes exist as phenomena generic to modern industrial societies. This paper addresses this issue by examining the structure of class situations, as defined by job attributes, in two central European, post-communist societies - Hungary and Poland - and then comparing them with a benchmark Western society, Britain. Classes are identified through a latent structure analysis of job attributes and by assessing the correspondence between the latent classes estimated through this procedure and positions on two alternative indicators of class position - the Goldthorpe class schema and self-rated class identity. The structure of latent classes is found to be generally similar across all three societies, as is the correspondence between these latent classes and positions in the Goldthorpe schema in the two societies in which it is measured, and class identification. The main exceptions to this shared pattern relate to variations in the size and organisation of the agricultural sector and the distinctiveness of 'intermediate' class positions. The evidence indicates the presence of a considerable degree of cross-national consistency in the structure of class situations across diverse social and political contexts.",2-s2.0-0033074913,7,1999,Sociology,0

We characterize the optimal dynamic schedule in a simplified setting that incorporates stochastic break durations and advertisement lengths of 15 and 30 seconds. The optimal policy is a ""greedy"" look-ahead rule that accounts for the remaining number of breaks; in this setting, there is no value to perfect information at the scheduling stage, and hence knowing the duration of all breaks would not change the schedule. We present heuristics to help solve scheduling problems of even greater complexity. The performance of these heuristics under various scenarios is tested by running simulations calibrated using industry data. The simple greedy heuristic is shown to perform well except when revenues are concave in ad length, in which case the look-ahead aspect of the optimal schedule becomes more important. Finally, we recommend ways for broadcasters to balance their portfolio of booked ads by determining the optimal overbooking level and mix of ads as a function of their associated revenues generated and penalties incurred.",2-s2.0-84964391103,3,2016,Management Science,0

Ethnic threat theories suggest that imprisonments will be more likely in jurisdictions with the most blacks or Hispanics, while economic threat theories suggest that the imprisoned population will be greater where economic stratification is most pronounced. After controlling for social disorganization, religious fundamentalism, political conservatism, and violent crimes, the results show that Republican strength and minority threat lead to higher imprisonment rates. Statistical interactions support predictions that these relationships became stronger after greater Republican stress on law and order. The latter findings confirm theoretical expectations that these relationships are historically contingent.",2-s2.0-0035458213,7,2001,Social Forces,0

Although film, television, and video play an important role in modern societies, the extent to which the similarities of cinematographic images to natural, unmediated conditions of visual experience contribute to viewers' comprehension is largely an open question. To address this question, we compared 20 inexperienced adult viewers from southern Turkey with groups of medium- and high-experienced adult viewers from the same region. In individual sessions, each participant was shown a set of 14 film clips that included a number of perceptual discontinuities typical for film. The viewers' interpretations were recorded and analyzed. The findings show that it is not the similarity to conditions of natural perception but the presence of a familiar line of action that determines the comprehensibility of films for inexperienced viewers. In the absence of such a line of action, extended prior experience is required for appropriate interpretation of cinematographic images such as those we investigated in this study.",2-s2.0-77954820049,6,2010,Psychological Science,0

In Experiment 2, participants wearing sunglasses behaved more selfishly than those wearing clear glasses. Finally, in Experiment 3, an illusory sense of anonymity mediated the relationship between darkness and self-interested behaviors. Across all three experiments, darkness had no bearing on actual anonymity, yet it still increased morally questionable behaviors.

By examining people's self-presentations to several targets across multiple dimensions, these 2 studies offer new insights into the nature of self-presentation and provide a novel paradigm for studying impression management. Results showed that most people rely on a relatively small number of basic self-presentational personas in which they convey particular profiles of impressions as a set and that these personas reflect both normative influences to project images that are appropriate to a particular target and distinctive influences by which people put an idiosyncratic spin on these normative images. Furthermore, although people's self-presentational profiles correlate moderately with their self-views, they tailor their public images to specific targets. The degree to which participants' self-presentations were normative and distinctive, as well as the extent to which they reflected their own self-views, were moderated by individual differences in agreeableness, self-esteem, authenticity, and Machiavellianism.",2-s2.0-82855171107,6,2011,Journal of Personality and Social Psychology,0

However, we know surprisingly little about the strategies individuals employ when networking and, in particular, the underlying agency mechanisms involved. Network analysis tends to presume structural determinism and ignore issues of endogeneity rather than explore how actors draw on schemas, beliefs, and values in developing their networks. This empirical paper induces three networking strategies of newly promoted service professionals operating within two firms (AuditCo and ConsultCo) over a 16-month period. Using a grounded theory building approach, we first establish a set of core categories that capture networking behavior. We then conduct a cluster analysis revealing three distinct networking configurations or strategies: Devoted Players, Purists, and Selective Players. We also reveal the distinct agency involved in each profile and investigate the extent to which these networking strategies correlate with variables that shed light on issues of endogeneity and deepen our understanding of the strategies (including network structure and socialization progress in the players' new jobs).",2-s2.0-84893365385,3,2014,Organization Science,0

Organizational scholars suggest that abductive reasoning fits complex situations and may address many of the challenges of complexity. Abductive reasoning is a form of reasoning that generates and evaluates hypotheses in order to make sense of puzzling facts. Existing research on abductive reasoning makes a number of important contributions, but does not explain how innovators can use abductive reasoning to formulate hypotheses for possible new products and then use these hypotheses to navigate in the labyrinth of complex product innovation. We interviewed 85 scientists and managers working in the biopharmaceutical industry and use grounded theory building to develop a new framework. Our framework identifies three social mechanisms that explain how innovators use abductive reasoning to detect useful information despite the noise, avoid competency traps and local optima, and accumulate insights in a holistic way.

Income varies considerably within countries and the locations where conflicts emerge are rarely typical or representative for states at large. Yet, most research on conflict has only examined national income averages and neglected spatial variation. The authors argue that civil conflicts are more likely to erupt in areas with low absolute income, even if a country's gross domestic product (GDP) per capita is not necessarily low, and in areas with large deviations from national averages. The authors test these hypotheses empirically using spatially disaggregated data on the location of conflict outbreaks and per capita income estimates. The authors find that areas with absolute poverty indeed see more outbreaks of conflict, and they find some evidence that inequality increases the risk of conflict.

This paper explores what the theory of individuals implies for households that have more than one member. We make minimal assumptions about how the individual members of the household resolve conflicts. All we assume is that however decisions are made, outcomes are efficient. We refer to this as the collective setting. We show that in the collective setting household demands must satisfy a symmetry and rank condition on the Slutsky matrix. We also present some further results on the effects on demands of variables that do not modify preferences but that do affect how decisions are made. We apply our theory to a series of surveys of household expenditures from Canada. The tests of the usual symmetry conditions are rejected for two-person households but not for one-person households. We also show that income pooling is rejected for two-person households. We then test for our collective setting conditions on the couples data. None of the collective setting restrictions are rejected.

The buyer's forecasting behavior is characterized by the frequency and magnitude of forecast revisions it requests (forecast volatility) as well as by the fraction of orders that were forecasted but never actually purchased (forecast inflation). The supplier's delivery performance is measured by its ability to meet delivery dates requested by the customers. Based on a duration analysis, we are able to show that suppliers penalize buyers for unreliable forecasts by providing lower service levels.

In a multiproduct retailing context, an approach for testing marketing mix variables is presented that should be of interest to retailers and researchers alike. Traditional model building for decision evaluation purposes suffers from a serious drawback in that the underlying model is assumed to be known. The present approach incorporates the search for the ""true"" model as an intrinsic part of the method. Based on up to date modeling perspectives, the approach can be divided into three steps: (1)the use of multiple time series analysis to assist in model specification; (2) the choice of functional form, model estimation and testing; and (3) the use of statistical and simulation methods to test decision making hypotheses. The approach is applied to three years of a western wear retailer's weekly sales and advertising data; multiple time series analysis is used to specify a simultaneous equation model that captures demand interdependences. After subjecting the model to several stability tests, it is then used as a basis for testing several interesting hypotheses concerning the retailer 's advertising decision making behavior. The key insight for multiproduct retailers is that advertising budget allocation decisions across products and media are probably more important than decisions affecting the level of the total budget since the former have a greater impact on profit contribution.",2-s2.0-0000533304,4,1995,Journal of Retailing,0

In decisions involving choice under strict uncertainty, decision makers' choice heuristics varied widely depending on the task conditions. Two experimental task variables, the format of the outcome distribution and the presence or absence of a time constraint, were used to test the sensitivity of choice processes and choice preferences in these decisions. With no time constraint, decision makers made compensatory tradeoffs on the displayed information when the distribution of outcomes was presented as a range, but they used a loss minimization heuristic when the distribution was presented as variability around the range midpoint. With a time constraint, decision makers used a loss minimization heuristic when exposed to the range format presentation of outcomes, whereas in the midpoint format, they focused on the midpoint outcome. Choice preferences also shifted with changes in time constraint. With no time constraint, decision makers preferred high variability alternatives when outcomes were presented in range format, but low variability alternatives in midpoint format presentation. With a time constraint these preferences reversed. Decision makers seemed to adapt their choice processing to the decision conditions rather than using some canonical choice rule regardless of the conditions. This result is consistent with the findings of previous studies that looked at risky choice and risk-free choice. The implication is that although people may have intuitive models of choice under strict uncertainty such as loss minimization, the stronger factor in determining how they make their decisions seems to be the actual task conditions of the decision,",2-s2.0-0030138401,3,1996,Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes,0

The authors addressed this question by reviewing 24 studies that assessed trauma exposure and overgenerality, examining samples with posttraumatic stress disorder, acute stress disorder, depression, traumatic event exposure, and other clinical disorders. Limitations are discussed, including variations in assessment of events, depression, and overgenerality and the need for additional comparison groups. Across studies, there was no consistent association between trauma exposure and overgenerality, suggesting that trauma exposure is unlikely to be the primary mechanism leading to overgenerality. Instead, psychopathology factors such as depression and posttraumatic stress appear to be more consistently associated with overgenerality.

Explaining poll-worker discretion. As street-level bureaucrats, poll workers bear the primary responsibility for implementing voter identification requirements. Voter identification requirements are not implemented equally across groups of voters, and poll workers exercise substantial discretion in how they apply election law. In states with minimal and varying identification requirements, poll workers appear to treat especially minority voters differently, requesting more stringent voter identification. We explain why poll workers are different from other street-level bureaucrats and how traditional mechanisms of control have little impact on limiting poll-worker discretion. We test why many poll workers appear not to follow the law using a post-election survey of New Mexico poll workers. We find little evidence that race, training, or partisanship matters. Instead, poll worker attitudes toward photo-identification policies and their educational attainment influences implementation of voter-identification laws.",2-s2.0-84911444787,5,2014,Journal of Politics,0

Moreover, for a class of ""large"" local alternatives the consistent ICM test is more powerful than the parametric t test in a neighborhood of the parametric alternative involved. Furthermore, under the assumption of normal errors the ICM test is asymptotically admissible, in the sense that there does not exist a test that is uniformly more powerful.

We design an experiment to explore the impact of earned entitlements on the frequency and intensity of conflicts in a two-stage conflict game where players may attempt to use non-binding side-payments to avoid conflict. In this game, Proposers make offers and Responders decide simultaneously whether to accept the offers and whether to engage in a conflict. A simple theoretical analysis suggests that Proposers should never offer side-payments because Responders should always accept them and then still choose to enter conflict; however, our experiment reveals that some individuals use this non-binding mechanism to avoid conflict. Moreover, when subjects earn their roles (Proposer or Responder), conflicts are 44% more likely to be avoided than when roles are assigned randomly. Earned entitlements impact behavior in three important ways: (1) Proposers who have earned their position persistently make larger offers; (2) larger offers lead to a lower probability of conflict; but (3) Proposers whose offers do not lead to conflict resolution respond spitefully with greater conflict expenditure. Hence, with earned rights, the positive welfare effects of reduced conflict frequency are offset by higher conflict intensity. This result differs from previous experimental evidence from ultimatum games in which earned entitlements tend to encourage agreement and increase welfare; thus, our findings highlight the important consequences of endogenizing the costs of conflict. Our analysis suggests that earned entitlements alter behavior by influencing the beliefs of Proposers about the willingness of Responders to accept a peaceful resolution. As a result, these Proposers make persistent high offers, and when their beliefs are disappointed by a Responder's decision to accept a side-payment and still enter conflict, they retaliate.",2-s2.0-84893360894,5,2014,Journal of Peace Research,0

It makes several contributions to our understanding of when and why focus groups are used in the social sciences. First, the study explains that focus groups generate data at three units of analysis, namely, the individual, the group, and the interaction. Although most researchers rely upon the individual unit of analysis, the method’s comparative advantage lies in the group and interactive units. Second, it reveals strong affinities between each unit of analysis and the primary motivation for using focus groups as a data collection method. The individual unit of analysis is appropriate for triangulation; the group unit is appropriate as a pretest; and the interactive unit is appropriate for exploration. Finally, it offers a set of guidelines that researchers should adopt when presenting focus groups as part of their research design. Researchers should, first, state the main purpose of the focus group in a research design; second, identify the primary unit of analysis exploited; and finally, list the questions used to collect data in the focus group.",2-s2.0-84963713708,7,2014,Sociological Methods and Research,0

When researchers from different fields with different norms collaborate, the question arises of how name-ordering conventions are chosen and how they affect contribution credits. In this paper, we answer these questions by studying two disciplines that exemplify the two cornerstones of name-ordering conventions: lexicographical ordering (i.e., alphabetical ordering, endorsed in economics) and nonlexicographical ordering (i.e., ordering according to individual contributions, endorsed in psychology). Inferences about credits are unambiguous in the latter arrangement but imperfect in the former, because alphabetical listing can reflect ordering according to individual contributions by chance. We contrast the fields of economics and psychology with marketing, a discipline heavily influenced by both. Based on archival data, consisting of more than 38,000 journal articles, we show that the three fields have different ordering practices. In two empirical studies with 351 faculty and graduate student participants from all three disciplines, as well as in a computer simulation, we show that ordering practices systematically affect and shape the allocation of perceived contributions and credit. Whereas strong disciplinary norms in economics and psychology govern the allocation of contribution credits, a more heterogeneous picture emerges for marketing.

Building on the assumptions of transaction cost accounts of employment, we develop a new theory that focuses on the interaction between the problems of evaluating and integrating external hires, on the one hand, and the incentive costs of failing to promote eligible workers, on the other. These arguments lead us to predict how three specific characteristics of jobs-demands for firm-specific skills, performance variability, and supply of internal candidates- affect how those jobs are staffed. Using seven years of personnel data spanning all jobs from the U.S. offices of a large investment bank, we find that jobs with higher performance variability and a larger grade ratio of junior to senior workers are more likely to be filled by internal mobility. We also find evidence that the effects of performance variability are contingent on the grade ratio, affecting staffing decsions only when the firm does not face strong pressures to promote junior workers in order to maintain incentives.

Eighty-four leaders of four-person decision-making teams performed 63 decisions on a computerized decision-making task. Both experience and providing leaders with cumulative staff past accuracy information were related to greater staff weighting variability and greater staff weighting accuracy. Although positively related to staff weighting, staff confidence information did not improve leader weighting variability nor actual staff weighting accuracy.",2-s2.0-0001391996,3,1999,Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes,0

People are adept at forming impressions of others, but how easily can impressions be updated? Although implicit first impressions have been characterized as difficult to overturn, recent work shows that they can be reversed through reinterpretation of earlier learning. However, such reversal has been demonstrated only in the same experimental session in which the impression formed, suggesting that implicit updating might be possible only within a brief temporal window, before impressions are consolidated and when memory about the initial information is strongest. Implicit impressions may be unable to be revised when reinterpreting details are learned later, due to memory consolidation or forgetting of the details to be reinterpreted. This study tested whether implicit first impressions can be reversed through reinterpretation after a two-day delay following the initial formation. Results showed that implicit revision emerged after the delay, even among those with poor explicit recall or who were not cued to recall. We discuss implications for theory on impression formation and updating.",2-s2.0-84977585276,6,2017,Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,0

In this paper, I argue that the features of the media environment after 9/11, particularly the media's emphasis on threatening information and evocative imagery, increased the public's probability of supporting the policies advocated by political leaders, principally the president. Using the National Election Studies 2000-2004 panel and a controlled, randomized experiment, I demonstrate that citizens form significantly different foreign policy views when the information environment is emotionally powerful than when it is free of emotion, even when the factual information is exactly the same. Citizens concerned about terrorism are more likely to adopt the hawkish foreign policy views communicated in threatening news stories when that policy is matched with fear-inducing cues than when it is not. These findings suggest that the role of the media is broader than simply providing a conduit for elites to speak to the public; the media influences the public through their own means as well.",2-s2.0-77951222215,5,2010,Journal of Politics,0

This article shows that price rigidity can alternatively reflect optimal price setting when there are no adjustment costs, namely, if the seller is rationally inattentive. The model generates non-trivial pricing patterns that are consistent with the data and that are hard to explain with the traditional adjustment-cost model. In particular, prices are adjusted frequently but move back and forth between a few given values, hazard functions are downward sloping, and responses to persistent shocks are sluggish. These results are obtained in a model that implements rational inattention without simplifying assumptions on the functional forms of the processed signals.",2-s2.0-84991380391,2,2016,Review of Economic Studies,0

Following more than 30 years of rising incarceration rates, the United States now imprisons a higher proportion of its population than any country in the world. Building on theories of representation and organized interest group behavior, this article argues that an increasingly punitive public has been a primary reason for this prolific expansion. To test this hypothesis, I generate a new over-time measure of the public's support for being tough on crime. The analysis suggests that, controlling for the crime rate, illegal drug use, inequality, and the party in power, since 1953 public opinion has been a fundamental determinant of changes in the incarceration rate. If the public's punitiveness had stopped rising in the mid-1970s, the results imply that there would have been approximately 20% fewer incarcerations. Additionally, an analysis of congressional attention to criminal justice issues supports the argument that the public's attitudes have led, not followed, political elites.",2-s2.0-84907992917,5,2014,American Journal of Political Science,0

Given that the leadership decided to use Appropriations as one of the vehicles of major policy change, they and the Conference sought to monitor the committee's actions, and to influence it to behave as they wanted. The leaders used their enhanced powers over incentives and with regard to the agenda to advance the party cause.

This chapter critically examines research on the impact of psychological and psychosocial factors on the development and outcome of coronary heart disease, with particular emphasis on studies employing verifiable outcomes of CAD morbidity or mortality. Five key variables identified as possible psychosocial risk factors for CAD are addressed: acute and chronic stress, hostility, depression, social support, and socioeconomic status. Evidence regarding the efficacy of psychosocial interventions is also presented. It is suggested that, taken as a whole, evidence for a psychological and social impact on CAD morbidity and mortality is convincing.

We review current thinking on the distinction between shame and guilt, and the relative advantages and disadvantages of these two moral emotions. Several new areas of research are highlighted: research on the domain-specific phenomenon of body shame, styles of coping with shame, psychobiological aspects of shame, the link between childhood abuse and later proneness to shame, and the phenomena of vicarious or ""collective"" experiences of shame and guilt. In recent years, the concept of moral emotions has been expanded to include several positive emotions - elevation, gratitude, and the sometimes morally relevant experience of pride.

A supplement to the Current Population Survey (CPS) was conducted in 2004 to examine telephone service and usage in U.S. households. This article explores the potential for biases in RDD surveys resulting from the increases in cell phones by presenting estimates of the percentage of households with different types of telephone service, including the percentage of cell-only households, and giving demographic profiles of households by type of telephone service. Logistic regression models examine variables that predict whether households are without a telephone or only have cell phones. These predictors may be used for weighting adjustments to reduce undercoverage biases. We address some additional issues, including the wording of questions for measuring telephone service, that are relevant if telephone-sampling methods are revised to include cell phones. The estimates from the CPS supplement are also used to help understand some of the new sampling and weighting problems associated with selecting samples from cell phone numbers.",2-s2.0-34047101247,5,2007,Public Opinion Quarterly,0

As a consequence, scholars cannot apply MrP in countries without detailed census data, and when such data are available, the modeling is restricted to a few variables. This article introduces multilevel regression with synthetic poststratification (MrsP), which relaxes the data requirement of MrP to marginal distributions, substantially increases the prediction precision of the method, and extends its use to countries without census data. The findings of Monte Carlo, U.S., and Swiss analyses show that, using the same predictors, MrsP usually performs in standard applications as well as the currently used standard approach, and it is superior when additional predictors are modeled.

As most of this research has been directed at black-white relations, the applicability of these theories to a multiethnic context remains unclear. Using data that merge the 1992-1994 Multi-City Study of Urban Inequality and 1990 Census, we find that in neighborhood contexts, interethnic propinquity corresponds with lower levels of out-group prejudice and competition, although intergroup hostility is higher in metropolitan areas with greater minority populations. Further tests suggest that these results do not occur from individual self-selection; rather ethnic spatial and social isolation bolster negative out-group perceptions.

Despite the wide endorsement of the importance of self-esteem, there remains substantial variation in theoretical conceptions of how self-esteem functions. To help address this point, 234 5-year-old children were tested across 3 studies using a new implicit measure. A new Preschool Implicit Association Test (PSIAT) was used to assess the association of (a) me with good (self-esteem), (b) me with boy or girl (gender identity), and (c) boy or girl with good (gender attitude). The results documented self-esteem in 5-year-olds, as well as own-gender identity and gender in-group preferences. Interestingly, children who had high self-esteem and strong own-gender identity displayed gender in-group preferences, supporting balanced identity theory's theoretical expectations that implicit self-esteem serves an identity-maintenance function, even for young children.

Prior research has distinguished networks that are emergent from networks that are orchestrated. While empirical studies have shown situations in which the role and scope of intentional governance of whole interorganizational networks has changed in time, and there is a growing interest regarding the endogenous drivers of network dynamics, the dimensions that influence intentional governance of network structure dynamics and the way this is carried out remain still to be elucidated. In order to pinpoint these drivers, we leverage the models of network structure dynamics elaborated within studies conducted at the intersection between network research and complexity science to propose a multilevel interpretive framework that clarifies the role and scope of intentional agency at different structural levels of interorganizational networks. Our framework advances a twofold conceptual contribution: on one hand, we tackle the change in the role and scope of intentional governance of network structures in both the early stages and the later stages of network evolution. On the other, we interpret the network of formal ties as resembling the accelerating network model, with the network of informal ties being akin to the scale-free (or truncated scale-free) network model of complex networks theory.",2-s2.0-84959341251,3,2016,Organization Studies,0

Drawing on state goal orientation theory, we analyze the motivational drivers that position teams to effectively deal with such challenges. We propose a novel approach for managing team motivational states that involves adapting team goal preferences at key points in the innovation process in order to achieve radical innovation success. We advance a model highlighting teams' ability to dynamically shift shared goal orientations to meet acute ""shocks"" that disrupt regular team activities and threaten the survival of the innovation project. We identify the roles of ambidextrous leadership and reflexive team processes in achieving goal orientation shifts as important factors in radical innovation success. Although unanticipated challenges related to idea development and idea promotion may occur in both radical and incremental innovation projects, we argue that the effects are stronger the more radical the innovation.",2-s2.0-84907569059,3,2014,Academy of Management Review,0

We investigate the hierarchical contributions of subsets of cues to the judgment of children's early achievement in reading. Twenty student teachers judged 118 profiles of actual kindergarten children on two related ecological criteria: end-of-year achievement on measures of vocabulary development and reading comprehension. Each profile contained five cues: two cues were demographic in nature (socioeconomic status and teaching curriculum); the remaining three cues concerned various cognitive abilities of the child (knowledge of books and print conventions, knowledge of names and sounds of the alphabet letters, and oral language comprehension). Using the hierarchical multivariate lens model, the unique contribution of the cognitive cue subset over and above the demographic cue subset to achievement in the judgment task was assessed. Results showed a substantial contribution of the cognitive cue subset to multivariate judgmental achievement beyond the demographic cue subset alone. Additional diagnostic indices from the multivariate lens model analysis (i.e., various intercriterial and interjudgmental correlations) are discussed. Conclusions are drawn with respect to the overall adequacy of the multivariate judgments and to the potential impact of temporal sequencing of cue perceptions on subsequent judgmental processes.",2-s2.0-38249038299,3,1987,Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes,0

Consensus studies from 4 cultures-in Belgium, the Czech Republic, Estonia, and Germany-as well as secondary analyses of self- and observer-reported Revised NEO Personality Inventory (NEO PI-R) data from 29 cultures suggest that there is a cross-culturally replicable pattern of difference between internal and external perspectives for the Big Five personality traits. People see themselves as more neurotic and open to experience compared to how they are seen by other people. External observers generally hold a higher opinion of an individual's conscientiousness than he or she does about him- or herself. As a rule, people think that they have more positive emotions and excitement seeking but much less assertiveness than it seems from the vantage point of an external observer. This cross-culturally replicable disparity between internal and external perspectives was not consistent with predictions based on the actor-observer hypothesis because the size of the disparity was unrelated to the visibility of personality traits. A relatively strong negative correlation (r = -53) between the average self-minus-observer profile and social desirability ratings suggests that people in most studied cultures view themselves less favorably than they are perceived by others.",2-s2.0-77958530778,6,2010,Journal of Personality and Social Psychology,0

The persistence of restraint, stability and minimalism in India's nuclear policy is best explained with reference to its strategic culture. This constitutes an intermediate structure between the power-acquisition imperative of the structure of the international system and domestic choices on how power is actually constituted. Disaggregation of strategic culture into three analytically distinct components -the level of assumptions and beliefs, the opetational level and the structural frame - facilitates identification of the precise areas of continuity and change in a dynamic structure. The disjunctures observed, whether at one level or between levels, can then be subjected to social action in the pursuit of peace and stability. An examination of Indian strategic culture with respect to nuclear weapons on the basis of official and non-official preference structures reveals (a) high levels of continuity in the form of restrained responses to external and domestic pressures for change, and in a positive disposition toward arms control; and (b) a significant shift from high to low tolerance of ambiguity resulting from the steady growth of an operational, as opposed to a political, conception of nuclear weapons. The last creates space for nuclear instability. The anomaly can be corrected by exposing the deficiencies in the operational conception of deterrence, thereby reinforcing strategic stability.",2-s2.0-0035585111,5,2001,Journal of Peace Research,0

Inequalities which compromise equity, conflicting meanings of equity, and the contribution of in-hospital ethics seminars to ethical health services are considered. Qualitative research, combining sociological and philosophical methods, investigated the experiences of health care staff attempting to provide equitable services and their practical and ethical problems. A total of 70 staff at a teaching hospital and a district general hospital took part in semi-structured interviews, followed by 11 innovative in-hospital ethics seminars based on themes derived from the interviews. The 56 seminar participants usually began with clear statements of their equitable aims, but, encouraged by the health care ethicist, they went on to discuss their many concerns about obstacles which complicated the achievement of these aims. The sociological-ethics seminars provided unique opportunities for multi-disciplinary discussion of these inequalities and their impact on equitable intentions in health care. Analysis of the contradictions revealed during the seminars is guided by sociological theories that seek to explain the persistence of inequalities in health, and how NHS policies appear to perpetuate and increase them, despite practitioners' stated intentions to promote equality.",2-s2.0-1542351055,7,2004,Sociology,0

Recognizing transparent materials is especially challenging. Previous work on the perception of transparency has focused on objects composed of flat, infinitely thin filters. In the experiments reported here, we considered thick transparent objects, such as ice cubes, which are irregular in shape and can vary in refractive index. An important part of the visual evidence signaling the presence of such objects is distortions in the perceived shape of other objects in the scene. We propose a new class of visual cues derived from the distortion field induced by thick transparent objects, and we provide experimental evidence that cues arising from the distortion field predict both the successes and the failures of human perception in judging refractive indices.",2-s2.0-79958175211,6,2011,Psychological Science,0

Five studies examined whether the processes associated with unfulfilled goals would interfere with tasks that require the executive function, which has a limited focal capacity and can pursue only one goal at a time. In Studies 1 and 2, activating a goal nonconsciously and then manipulating unfulfillment caused impairments on later tasks requiring fluid intelligence (solving anagrams; Study 1) and impulse control (dieting; Study 2). Study 3 showed that impairments were specific to executive functioning tasks: an unfulfilled goal impaired performance on logic problems but not on a test of general knowledge (only the former requires executive functions). Study 4 found that the effect was moderated by individual differences; participants who reported a tendency to shift readily amongst their various pursuits showed no task interference. Study 5 found that returning to fulfill a previously frustrated goal eliminated the interference effect. These findings provide converging evidence that unfulfilled goals can interfere with later tasks, insofar as they require executive functions.",2-s2.0-79651474505,6,2011,Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,0

A discrete-time event history model can easily incorporate a multilevel design and time-varying covariates. A multilevel design is needed to account for dependencies among ties and vertices, which should not be ignored in a small longitudinal network. Time-varying covariates are required to analyze network effects, that is, the impact of previous ties. In addition, a discrete-time event history model handles constraints on who can act or who can be acted upon in a straightforward way.

It is a common trend in the retail industry for catalog retailers to mail multiple catalogs, each promoting different product categories. The existing catalog mailing models do not address the issue of optimizing multi-category catalog mailing. We address this research gap by introducing a model that integrates the when and what components of a customer's purchase decision into the how much component (number of catalogs) of a firm's cross-selling strategy. In addition to comparing the impact of category-specific versus full product catalogs in generating sales in a specific category, the study also finds relative impacts of various category-specific catalogs. We jointly estimate the probability of purchase and purchase amounts in multiple product categories by using multivariate proportional hazard model (MVPHM) and a regression based purchase amount model in a Hierarchical Bayesian framework. The model accounts for unobserved heterogeneity, and uses a control function (CF) approach to account for endogeneity in catalog mailing. The results from the Genetic Algorithm (GA) based optimization suggest that the catalog mailing policy as per the proposed model would be able to generate 38.4 percent more customer lifetime value (CLV) from a sample of 10 percent of the households as compared to the current catalog mailing policy of the retailer by reallocation of the catalogs across customers and mailing periods based on their propensity to buy.",2-s2.0-84887608860,4,2013,Journal of Retailing,0

The amount of bias, however, cannot be assessed without information that is unavailable in typical applications of EI. We therefore construct a model that at least approximately accounts for the additional, nonsampling error that may result from possible bias incurred by an EI procedure, a model that builds on the Principle of Maximum Entropy. By means of a systematic simulation experiment, we examine the performance of prediction intervals based on this second-stage Maximum Entropy model. The results of this simulation study suggest that these prediction intervals are at least approximately correct if all possible configurations of the unknown data are taken into account.

Every year, 90% of Americans give money to charities. Is such generosity necessarily welfare enhancing for the giver? We present a theoretical framework that distinguishes two types of motivation: individuals like to give, for example, due to altruism or warm glow, and individuals would rather not give but dislike saying no, for example, due to social pressure. We design a door-to-door fund-raiser in which some households are informed about the exact time of solicitation with a flyer on their doorknobs. Thus, they can seek or avoid the fund-raiser. We find that the flyer reduces the share of households opening the door by 9% to 25% and, if the flyer allows checking a Do Not Disturb box, reduces giving by 28% to 42%. The latter decrease is concentrated among donations smaller than $10. These findings suggest that social pressure is an important determinant of door-to-door giving. Combining data from this and a complementary field experiment, we structurally estimate the model. The estimated social pressure cost of saying no to a solicitor is $3.80 for an in-state charity and $1.40 for an out-of-state charity.

Academia has become an increasingly common political target, particularly the institution of academic tenure, which many conservative politicians accuse of helping to perpetuate the ideological indoctrination of students. This study focuses on students' perceptions of professors' ideology by examining the link between student ideology, professor favorability, and perceptions of professors' ideology. We employ an original survey instrument and find that, rather than forming perceptions of their professors' political views based on their professors' actual positions, students tend to project their own ideology onto their professor, based on the extent to which they like their professor.

We use detailed income, balance sheet, and cash flow statements constructed for households in a long monthly panel in an emerging market economy, and some recent contributions in economic theory, to document and better understand the factors underlying success in achieving upward mobility in the distribution of net worth. Wealth inequality is decreasing over time, and many households work their way out of poverty and lower wealth over the seven year period. The accounts establish that, mechanically, this is largely due to savings rather than incoming gifts and remittances. In turn, the growth of net worth can be decomposed household by household into the savings rate and how productively that savings is used, the return on assets (ROA). The latter plays the larger role. ROA is, in turn, positively correlated with higher education of household members, younger age of the head, and with a higher debt/asset ratio and lower initial wealth, so it seems from cross-sections that the financial system is imperfectly channeling resources to productive and poor households. Household fixed effects account for the larger part of ROA, and this success is largely persistent, undercutting the story that successful entrepreneurs are those that simply get lucky. Persistence does vary across households, and in at least one province with much change and increasing opportunities, ROA changes as households move over time to higher-return occupations. But for those households with high and persistent ROA, the savings rate is higher, consistent with some micro founded macro models with imperfect credit markets. Indeed, high ROA households save by investing in their own enterprises and adopt consistent financial strategies for smoothing fluctuations. More generally growth of wealth, savings levels and/or rates are correlated with TFP and the household fixed effects that are the larger part of ROA.",2-s2.0-79952443931,2,2011,Journal of Econometrics,0

People frequently encounter messages framing abstract sociopolitical issues (e.g., drug law enforcement) metaphorically in terms of superficially unrelated, more concrete concepts (e.g., military combat). These metaphoric framings are not mere figures of speech; instead, they prompt observers to interpret the target issue using their knowledge of the concrete concept, despite their surface differences. In this paper we examine how this effect is moderated by observers' motivation to think about the target issue. Integrating conceptual metaphor and lay epistemology theories, we propose that metaphor can satisfy three epistemic motives: to be certain, consistent, and accurate. Studies 1a-b provide preliminary evidence that participants exposed to a metaphoric framing transfer knowledge of a concrete concept (vehicle operation) to interpret a target issue (system failure). Studies 2 to 4 show that this effect holds only when the metaphoric framing serves an epistemic motive. Findings illuminate when and why people rely on metaphor to think.",2-s2.0-84898619824,6,2014,Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,0

This article considers a market served by a monopolist who sells a durable good that depreciates stochastically over time. We show that there exist three types of stationary equilibria: a Coase Conjecture equilibrium, a monopoly equilibrium, and a reputational equilibrium. When the depreciation rate is low, the Coase Conjecture equilibrium is the unique equilibrium. For intermediate values of the depreciation rate, all three equilibrium types coexist. When the depreciation rate is high, the monopoly equilibrium is the unique equilibrium. Consequently, when selling a good of sufficiently low durability, the monopolist does not lose any of her monopoly power. Furthermore, the steady-state output in the reputational equilibrium falls below the monopoly quantity. Hence, in durable goods markets, welfare losses due to monopoly power may be larger than in markets for perishables. Copyright",2-s2.0-44249126793,2,2008,RAND Journal of Economics,0

Past research has consistently demonstrated that creating a sense of a common ingroup identity can be beneficial for reducing intergroup tensions and creating intergroup harmony. At the same time, however, creating a strong sense of a common ingroup identity has elements that may undermine disadvantaged-group members' motivation for collective action toward social change. In the present paper, we report two experiments that investigated how, compared to salient separate ethnic/racial identities, increasing the salience of a common US identity among Blacks and Latinos results in lower collective action intentions. These effects were mediated by a reduction in group-based anger and group-efficacy beliefs, and, in Experiment 2, reduced recognition of group-based inequality in society as well. Increasing salience of common ingroup and separate group identities simultaneously (a dual identity), however, did not decrease collective action intentions.

This paper builds on this research and explores the robustness of the phenomenon across two dimensions - (1) the level of temporal aggregation and (2) the dollar magnitude of the transaction. First, we show that the effectiveness of a pennies-a-day strategy is not limited to per-day framing. Rather, we find a more general phenomenon in which a ""less aggregate"" expense is preferred to a ""more aggregate"" expense, such that if a per-day framing is preferred to a per-year framing, than a per-month framing also will be preferred to a per-year framing. Second, we show that this effectiveness reverses with the magnitude of the underlying expense, such that while a framing of ""$1 per day"" is preferred to one of ""$365 per year,"" a framing of ""$4200 per year"" is preferred to one of ""$11.50 per day"".",2-s2.0-4043107158,4,2003,Marketing Letters,0

Yet little research examines how a job's position within a larger job structure affects its life chances and thus the evolution of the larger job structure over time. In this article, we explore the impact of technical interdependence on the dynamics of job structures. We argue that jobs that are more enmeshed in a job structure through these interdependencies are more likely to survive. We test our theory on a quarter century of personnel and job description data for the nonacademic staff of one of America's largest public universities. Our results provide support for our key hypotheses: jobs that are more enmeshed in clusters of technical interdependence are less likely to die. At the same time, being part of such a cluster means that a job is more vulnerable if its neighbors disappear. And the ""protection"" of technical interdependence is contingent: it does not hold in the face of strategic change or other organizational restructurings.

This article is about a simple two-variable equation forecasting presidential election outcomes and a three-variable equation forecasting seat change in House elections. Over the past two decades a cottage industry of political forecasting has developed (Lewis-Beck and Rice 1992; Campbell and Garand 2000). At the 1994 meeting of the Southern Political Science Association, several participants offered their forecasts of the upcoming midterm House elections. Unfortunately, not one of the forecasters was within 20 seats of the actual outcome. If, however, these forecasts had been pooled, as Gaddie (1997) points out, then they would have come remarkably close to the actual seat change that occurred. Moving forward, at the 1996 APSA Annual Meeting the collection of forecasters did a much better job with that year's presidential election. The forecasters also got the overall popular vote outcome correct at the 2000 APSA Annual Meeting for that year's presidential election. We all forecasted a victory for Al Gore, with James Campbell coming the closest to the actual total (50.2%) at 52.8%. At the panel at the 2004 APSA Annual Meeting almost every forecaster predicted the actual outcome correctly.

Current accounts of the capitalist and Protestant origins of the democratic public sphere are inconsistent and speculative. This empirical account explains the transition in political communication from norms of secrecy to appeals to public opinion. Popular communicative change in the English Revolution anticipated, in practice, the democratic theory of the public sphere when printing transformed a traditional instrument of communication - the petition. Petitions had medieval origins and traditions that upheld norms of secrecy and privilege in political communication. Economic and technical properties of printing - namely, heightened commercialism and the capacity to reproduce texts - demolished these norms by changing the scope and content of communication by petition. This practical innovation appears in all factions in the revolution. But among radical groups, the political use of printed petitions led to novel theories and to democratic speculation on constitutional provisions that would ensure the authority of public opinion in politics. This analysis contradicts key assumptions on communicative change that fuel pessimistic assessments of the modern public sphere in post-modernism and critical theory.",2-s2.0-0030556311,7,1996,American Journal of Sociology,0

However, Hispanic immigrants are disproportionately young males who regardless of citizenship are at greater risk of criminal involvement. They are also more vulnerable to restrictive treatment in the criminal justice system, especially at the pre-trial stage. When these differences are integrated into calculations using equations that begin with observed numbers of immigrants and citizens in state prisons, it is estimated that the involvement of Hispanic immigrants in crime is less than that of citizens. These results cast doubt on the hypothesis that immigration causes crime and make more transparent the immigration and criminal justice policies that inflate the rate of Hispanic incarceration. This transparency helps to resolve a paradox in the picture of Mexican immigration to the United States, since by most measures of well-being, Mexican immigrants are found to do as well and sometimes better than citizens.",2-s2.0-0033229642,7,1999,Social Problems,0

Research on the distribution of resources typically focuses on anticipated outcomes. This paper investigates the social norms people use to distribute adventitious (unanticipated) outcomes. Participants in this study read a scenario where either they, or the person they were with (an acquaintance or a friend), received either an unexpected gain or loss which was or was not easily divisible. Participants were then asked to continue the story by describing what they believed would happen after the adventitious event. We measured if and how the outcome was divided between the two individuals involved as well as subjects' and an outside observer's perceptions of the fairness of these divisions and any expectations they had about the effect of the event on the quality of the relationship between the two. Results suggest that people endorse a ""losers weepers"" norm more often than they do a ""finders keepers"" or ""share and share alike"" (equality) norm, although all were endorsed. Egocentric distributions and expectations permeated the story continuations. Although participants frequently suggest that they would share gains, they also expected that their sacrifices (sharing their own gain or in another's loss) would help improve the future relationship between the two more than would similar sacrifices by the other (i.e., they were often egocentric martyrs). Friendship and the divisibility of the outcome also affected allocation rules and expectations for the future relationship. The discussion highlights the irony associated with the finding that when an adventitious gain is not shared with another, the future relationship between the two is expected to be less positive.

While the strategies for managing conflicts employed by these peoples are comparable to those used in many other small-scale societies, their world-views of peacefulness and the structures they use to reinforce those world-views do distinguish them from other societies. Several common notions about conflict and conflict resolution that are asserted by Western scholars can be questioned in light of the success of these societies in peacefully resolving conflicts: namely, that violent conflict is inevitable in all societies; that punishment and armed force prevent internal and external violence; that political structures are necessary to prevent conflicts; and that conflict should be viewed as positive and necessary. The contrary evidence is that over half of the peaceful societies have no recorded violence; they rarely punish other adults (except for the threat of ostracism); they handle conflicts with outside societies in the same peaceful ways that they approach internal conflicts; they do not look to outside governments when they have internal disputes; and they have a highly negative view of conflict.",2-s2.0-0030508297,5,1996,Journal of Peace Research,0

Customers contribute to service quality through their roles as promoters of the firm, co-producers of the firm 's service and consultants to the organization. A model of customer voluntary performance (CVP) is developed and empirically tested with a sample of grocery customers. Customer voluntary performance refers to helpful, discretionary customer behaviors that support the ability of the firm to deliver service quality. Global customer satisfaction, perceived support for customers and customer commitment are considered as antecedents of CVP. Interrelationships among these variables are also considered. The results provide support for eight of the twelve hypothesized relationships. Implications of the study are discussed for researchers and managers.",2-s2.0-0031229627,4,1997,Journal of Retailing,0

We study the formation of beliefs in a squatter settlement in the outskirts of Buenos Aires exploiting a natural experiment that induced an allocation of property rights that is exogenous to the characteristics of the squatters. There are significant differences in the beliefs that squatters with and without land titles declare to hold. Lucky squatters who end up with legal titles report beliefs closer to those that favor the workings of a free market. Examples include materialist and individualist beliefs (such as the belief that money is important for happiness or the belief that one can be successful without the support of a large group). The effects appear large. The value of a (generated) index of ""market"" beliefs is 20 percent higher for titled squatters than for untitled squatters, in spite of leading otherwise similar lives. Moreover, the effect is sufficiently large so as to make the beliefs of the squatters with legal titles broadly comparable to those of the general Buenos Aires population, in spite of the large differences in the lives they lead.",2-s2.0-33947662434,2,2007,Quarterly Journal of Economics,0

Divorce is a highly stressful event, and much remains to be learned about the factors that promote psychological resilience when marriages come to an end. In this study, divorcing adults (N = 109) completed a 4-min stream-of-consciousness recording about their marital separation at an initial laboratory visit. Four judges rated the degree to which participants exhibited self-compassion (defined by self-kindness, an awareness of one's place in shared humanity, and emotional equanimity) in their recordings. Judges evidenced considerable agreement in their ratings of participants' self-compassion, and these ratings demonstrated strong predictive utility: Higher levels of self-compassion at the initial visit were associated with less divorce-related emotional intrusion into daily life at the start of the study, and this effect persisted up to 9 months later. These effects held when we accounted for a number of competing predictors.

What is the primary function of consciousness in the nervous system? The answer to this question remains enigmatic, not so much because of a lack of relevant data, but because of the lack of a conceptual framework with which to interpret the data. To this end, we developed Passive Frame Theory, a internally-coherent framework that, from an action-based perspective, synthesizes empirically supported hypotheses from diverse fields of investigation. The theory proposes that the primary function of consciousness is well-circumscribed, serving the somatic nervous system. Inside this system, consciousness serves as a frame that constrains and directs skeletal muscle output, thereby yielding adaptive behavior. The mechanism by which consciousness achieves this is more counterintuitive, passive, and ‘low level’ than the kinds of functions that theorists have previously attributed to consciousness. Passive Frame Theory begins to illuminate (a) what consciousness contributes to nervous function, (b) how consciousness achieves this function, and (c) the neuroanatomical substrates of conscious processes. Our untraditional, action-based perspective focuses on olfaction instead of on vision and is descriptive (describing the products of nature as they evolved to be) rather than normative (construing processes in terms of how they should function). Passive Frame Theory begins to isolate the neuroanatomical, cognitive-mechanistic, and representational (e.g., conscious contents) processes associated with consciousness.

Additionally, subdimensions of the Intellect framework specifically predicted conceptually related criteria, including scholastic performance, vocational interest, and leisure activities. Furthermore, results from multidimensional scaling and higher order confirmatory factor analyses show that the framework allows for the incorporation of several constructs that have been proposed on different theoretical backgrounds, such as need for cognition, typical intellectual engagement, curiosity, intrinsic motivation, goal orientation, and openness to ideas.

Among the 41 participants who experienced a severe collision, the rate of g-force events dropped significantly in the 1st month after the collision, remained unchanged for the 2nd month, and increased significantly in the 3rd month. There were no changes in the rate of g-force events at comparable time points for the drivers not involved in a collision.

Most models of agenda control examine dyadic relations—for example, those between a committee and the floor of a legislature. Such relations, however, are always embedded in a larger context, namely, a political environment composed of voters and interest groups. In this paper we model agenda setters (a legislative committee) as decision makers with limited cognitive abilities who adjust over time to their larger political environment. The legislators’ policy positions are endogenous, reflecting the relative strengths of voters wielding the district-specific resource of votes and of interest groups wielding the transferable resource of money. The resulting outcomes indicate that neoclassical models of voting and pluralist models of group influence have each told part of the story. When only votes matter, our boundedly rational agents grope toward equilibria close to those of neoclassical models; however, when mobile resources matter as well, the outcomes depart systematically from those of previous models. In particular, interest groups can make themselves worse off by capturing the committee. The results suggest that agenda control is less powerful than conventionally believed and point toward conditions shaping its effectiveness—conditions highlighting the distinctive contributions of pluralist and neoclassical thinking to a broader theory of political institutions.",2-s2.0-84973946527,5,1986,American Political Science Review,0

Occupational and industrial expansion stimulated increased rates of job mobility within industries, while occupational and industrial contraction pushed workers out of their origin occupations and industries. The biggest effect of industrial or occupational contraction was to stimulate exits from employment, and ""cross-over"" effects were asymmetrical (i.e., industrial net change affected occupational mobility more than the reverse). Furthermore, individuals with few labor market resources generally showed greater sensitivity to structural turbulence.

This article charts and analyses the debates and discussions about class and identity over the last 30 years in the Federation of Worker Writers and Community Publishers (Fed). The Fed fostered a class identity that was sharpened through discussions about the role of middle-class sympathizers. Narrow definitions of class were continually widened as groups of women, black and gay groups asserted an autonomous identity and set up separate groups, sometimes in direct opposition to class. While one section of the Fed clung to a narrow conception of class, the majority welcomed the changes but were unwilling to jettison class. This evidence brings into question academic arguments that tended to assert that class, as a monolithic presence, has been simply undermined or replaced by new identities and new social movements. Too little attention has been paid to the persistent but changing meanings of class. Copyright",2-s2.0-27944443190,7,2005,Sociology,0

This study investigates characteristics that affect the relationship between firms' positions in a network of collaborative ties with other firms and their performance. Firms located in similarly structured networks rich in structural holes may obtain different performance results depending on their (1) capacity to absorb heterogeneous information, (2) ability to protect against partner noncooperation, and (3) bargaining power. In this paper, I argue that firms with a wide scope of experience have superior absorptive capacity for dealing with heterogeneous information; hence, such firms will be able to extract performance improvements from network positions rich in structural holes. Furthermore, firms with a high level of historic multimarket contact (MMC) with their partners are able to reduce the risks of partner noncooperation, hence augmenting their performance compared to firms in open networks that do not enjoy MMC with their own partners. Finally, firms of low centrality in the industry's network of alliances will extract performance benefits from enhancing bargaining power as a result of exploiting brokerage opportunities in open networks.

At 18 over half reported past year drug use and at 22 the rate is unchanged (52 percent). Past month use at 32 percent has declined slightly. Males are now slightly more likely to be drug-involved on all measures. Socio-economic differences are not significant. Cannabis dominates recent usage (average three episodes a month). Half the abstainers have friends who have used cannabis. Nearly two thirds of abstainers held tolerant or approving attitudes of drug takers. Half held different views about different drugs, with cannabis use being most tolerated. The paper concludes that 'sensible' recreational drug use is becoming increasingly accommodated into the social lives of conventional young adults.",2-s2.0-0036851428,7,2002,Sociology,0

In the field of organizational identity, theory development has far outpaced theory testing. Specifically, several researchers have proposed identity-based models of organizational identification but few have operationalized and tested them. Furthermore, virtually no research has explored how members identify with multiple-identity organizations. This study addresses these gaps and makes three specific contributions to identity theory. First, we operationalize and test a model in which a member's organizational identification is conceptualized in terms of an identity comparison process, i.e., a cognitive comparison between what a member perceives the identity to be and what they think it should be. Second, we extend current thinking by operationalizing organizational identification in terms of multiple and competing identities. Third, as a theory-building exercise, we explore the possibility that a similar identity comparison process operates at the organizational form level of analysis, affecting members' identification with the encompassing form or social institution. We test our model via a survey of members of rural cooperatives-a prototypical ""hybrid"" identity organizational form, embodying elements of both ""business"" and ""family"" identities. Results of the analyses show that organizational identity congruence has a significant effect on member commitment, and form-level identity congruence has significant effects on both cognitive and pragmatic legitimacy, lending support for the use of identity as a multilevel construct. These results provide empirical support for current identity-based models of organizational identification and expand their generalizability to include multiple-identity organizations.",2-s2.0-0036868597,3,2002,Organization Science,0

Although occupational segregation by sex has declined in recent decades with the rising numbers of women entering traditionally male occupations (e.g., law and medicine), the achievement of women within male-dominated occupations continues to lag behind that of their male colleagues. In this article, we draw on theories of proportional rarity, expectations states, and social support as three dimensions that provide a structural understanding of tokenism. We examine tokenism in the legal profession through: (1) organizational context in terms of gender composition and gender ratios at upper echelons of the organizational hierarchy; (2) status characteristics of theminority and dominant groups; and (3) the content of communications (emotional and informational support) that women receive from their colleagues. These communications may act to integrate, or conversely, through their absence, exclude women and heighten boundaries to women's career advancement within the traditionally male profession of law. We used questionnaire data collected from a sample of 740 married lawyers working in law firms to examine these aspects of tokenism. The results reveal that women's rising representation in law firms leads to enhanced communication through informational and emotional support, benefiting both men and women lawyers. Yet, a more gender balanced organizational context, in terms of gender composition, does little to shift the expectation states associated with women lawyers and the professional disadvantage women face when they have family responsibilities.",2-s2.0-84864556864,7,2012,Social Problems,0

The main assumptions of the models are that economic growth is influenced by (1) the economic level of the country, (2) foreign capital inflow, and (3) political factors. The influence of the economic level of a country is taken into account by using a simple savings function relating per capita savings linearly to GDP per capita. The impact of the political factors is intro duced in the models by letting the savings depend also upon those factors. The value of the contribution of foreign capital inflow to GDP growth is assumed to be a third of the value of the inflow itself. While mainly concerned with methodological proposals, the article also presents an empirical investigation of the importance of the political mobilization of various social groups for economic development, and how political integration influences economic growth.

Latent class analysis and K-means clustering are popular methods for partitioning objects based on dichotomous measures in the psychological literature. The K-median clustering method has recently been touted as a potentially useful tool for psychological data and might be preferable to its close neighbor, K-means, when the variable measures are dichotomous.

Although all 3 methods proved capable of recovering cluster structure, K-median clustering yielded the best average performance, followed closely by latent class analysis.

The purpose of this article is to determine whether the positive association between social support and well-being is attributable more to an overall beneficial effect of support (main- or direct-effect model) or to a process of support protecting persons from potentially adverse effects of stressful events (buffering model). The review of studies is organized according to (a) whether a measure assesses support structure or function, and (b) the degree of specificity (vs. globality) of the scale. By structure we mean simply the existence of relationships, and by function we mean the extent to which one's interpersonal relationships provide particular resources. Special attention is paid to methodological characteristics that are requisite for a fair comparison of the models. The review concludes that there is evidence consistent with both models. Evidence for a buffering model is found when the social support measure assesses the perceived availability of interpersonal resources that are responsive to the needs elicited by stressful events. Evidence for a main effect model is found when the support measure assesses a person's degree of integration in a large social network. Both conceptualizations of social support are correct in some respects, but each represents a different process through which social support may affect well-being.

In both settings, incumbency causes approximately a 20-25 percentage-point increase in the share of donations flowing to the incumbent's party. The effect size does not vary with legislator experience and does not appear to depend on incumbent office-holder benefits. Instead, as we show, the effect is primarily the result of donations from access-oriented interest groups, especially donors from industries under heavy regulation and those with less ideological ties. Given the role of money in elections, the findings suggest that access-oriented interest groups are an important driver of the electoral security of incumbents.

P. J. Kellman, P. Garrigan, and T. F. Shipley's (see record 2005-08166-003) theory of 3-dimensional object interpolation asserts that existing data, as well as logical considerations, support the view that an identical contour interpolation process underlies the interpolation of partially camouflaged and partially occluded objects (modal completion and amodal completion, respectively). Here, the author argues that recent data show that this theory is incorrect and that the logical arguments offered in support of the identity hypothesis depend on specific unverified models of the phenomena in question. Alternative explanations of these effects are developed to show that such phenomena do not logically implicate an identity hypothesis and, in some cases, provide strong evidence against the identity hypothesis. Finally, the author describes several completion phenomena that reveal that the relatability criteria embodied in Kellman et al.'s model are neither necessary nor sufficient for understanding the interpolation processes the model was designed to explain.

Intimacy is often motivated by love, but sometimes it is merely functional. For example, disrobing and being touched at an airport security check serves the goal of catching a flight, not building a relationship. We propose that this functional intimacy induces discomfort, making people prefer greater social distance from their interaction partner. Supporting this prediction, participants who considered (Experiments 1 and 2) or experienced (Experiment 3) more physically intimate medical procedures preferred a health provider who is less social. Increased psychological intimacy also led people to prefer social distance from cleaning and health providers (Experiments 4-5), a preference revealed by nonverbal behavior (e.g., turning away and looking away, Experiments 6-7). These patterns of distancing are unique to functional (vs. romantic) intimacy (Experiment 7). Although creating social distance may be an effective strategy for coping with functional intimacy, it may have costs for service providers.

This paper examines how a firm's financial distress and the legal environment regarding the ease of bankruptcy reorganization can alter product market competition and supplier-buyer relationships. We identify three effects-predation, bail-out, and abetment-that can change firms' behavior from their actions in the absence of financial distress. The predation effect increases competition before potential bankruptcy as the nondistressed competitor behaves as if it has some first-mover advantage that could benefit a supplier with price control. The bail-out effect reflects the supplier's incentive to grant the distressed firm concessions to preserve competition, improving supply chain efficiency and providing support for the exclusivity rule in Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code when the supplier and the distressed firm are financially linked. The abetment effect is that the supplier may deliberately abet the competitor's predation, leading to increased operational disadvantages for the distressed firm before bankruptcy. Together these effects stress that a firm's bankruptcy potential can hurt its competitors and benefit its suppliers/customers. They also provide guidelines for firms' operational decisions in such situations, a rationale for observed firm actions surrounding bankruptcies, and motivation for policies supporting reorganization and relaxing broad enforcement of nondiscriminatory pricing regulations.",2-s2.0-84943578133,3,2015,Management Science,0

We propose an approach for deriving joint space maps of bundle compositions and market segments from three-way (e.g., consumers × product options/benefits/features × usage situations/scenarios/time periods) pick-any/J data. The proposed latent structure multidimensional scaling procedure simultaneously extracts market segment and product option positions in a joint space map such that the closer a product option is to a particlar segment, the higher the likelihood of its being chosen by that segment. A segment-level threshold parameter is estimated that spatially delineates the bundle of product options that are predicted to be chosen by each segment. Estimates of the probability of each consumer belonging to the derived segments are simultaneously obtained. Explicit treatment of product and consumer characteristics are allowed via optional model reparameterizations of the product option locations and segment memberships. We illustrate the use of the proposed approach using an actual commercial application involving pick-any/J data gathered by a major hi-tech firm for some 23 advanced technological options for new automobiles.",2-s2.0-0007251907,4,1996,Marketing Letters,0

This paper studies model selection methods in the presence of nonstationarity. We focus on the Bayesian model selection rule and compare it with other criteria that are frequently used in econometric practice. First, we derive each of these criteria in the presence of nonstationarity. In particular, we study the Bayesian model selection rule in detail and derive three alternative forms of it in the presence of nonstationarity. One important feature of the Bayesian model selection criterion (BMSC) is that BMSC gives different weights to the stationary and nonstationary components of a model while the other criteria do not. This feature of BMSC is a desirable property for a model selection rule in the presence of possible nonstationarity. Second, we compare these criteria with regard to parsimony and power. We have found that BMSC shows the highest parsimony, AIC is the second, and Cp and R 2, having the same level of parsimony, are the third. With regard to power, the order is not clearly established. However, for the size adjusted power BMSC becomes dominant as the sample size increases. Without size adjustment the order in the power is exactly the opposite to that in parsimony. Also, we find that BMSC is a consistent selection rule while the other criteria are not. Third, we consider four different cases of practical interest for which BMSC with some of the other criteria is applicable. We discuss how our BMSC can be used in these cases of practical interest. Results of an extensive Monte Carlo simulation for models in these four cases show that overall the BMSC outperforms other criteria.",2-s2.0-84862815883,2,2012,Journal of Econometrics,0

Despite a strong interest in media coverage of social problems, sociologists have failed to examine when and why news outlets present issues as problems in need of public action within short time periods. Through content analysis of 475 newspaper articles and negative binomial regression, I show that coverage of homelessness varies in the extent to which it presents homelessness as a social problem. The fact that not all news coverage discusses social problems challenges the claim that social problems necessarily compete for attention in a zero-sum game. I also examine the effects of three types of events (events promoted to the media by their actors and high- and low-profile events not promoted by their actors) on newspapers' likelihood of describing homelessness as a social problem. While previous researchers predicted that events not promoted by their actors would lead to media coverage that challenged the status quo, I find that actor-promoted events are much more likely to do so. This finding highlights the importance of institutionalized action in calling attention to social problems.",2-s2.0-76549136276,7,2010,Social Problems,0

From the late 1960s on, although India has remained basically consociational, some of its power-sharing elements have weakened under the pressure of greater mass mobilization.

Sisters and sistering are peculiarly absent from the sociology of the family. Sociologists document women's roles as mothers, carers, workers, daughters and wives yet neglect their experiences as sisters. Our knowledge of this widespread tie derives more from media images than from women's own experiences. This article explores several reasons for this marginalization: from the sensational depiction of sisters in popular culture as either friends or rivals, and their mythical status in feminist politics, to the specialized interest of psy professionals and policy makers in childhood rivalry and sibling solidarity among the elderly. It reveals the paradox surrounding the silence of sistering as part of family lives and the visibility of sisterhood in the public and sociological imagination. Drawing on a qualitative study of sister relationships among girls and women aged 6-50, it illustrates the complexities of sistering as personal lived experience.

We tested whether the fast propagation along the dorsal-action pathway drives an accelerated conduction of fear-based content. Using a visual prior-entry procedure, we assessed accelerated stimulus perception while either suppressing the M pathway with red diffuse light or leaving it unaffected with green diffuse light. We show that the encoding of fearful faces is accelerated, but not when M-channel activity is suppressed, revealing a dissociation that implicates a privileged neural link between emotion and action that begins at the retina.",2-s2.0-77954823814,6,2010,Psychological Science,0

Across nineteen experimental comparisons, we find that mail surveys that incorporate a concurrent Web option have significantly lower response rates than those that do not. We propose several explanations for this result: adding a mode option may increase the complexity of responding, selecting the Web option could cause a break in the response process, or attempting to respond online may result in implementation failure.

This paper argues that within every organization there is a terrain which is not and cannot be managed, in which people, both individually and in groups, can engage in unsupervised, spontaneous activity. This is referred to as the unmanaged organization, a kind of organizational dreamworld in which desires, anxieties and emotions find expressions in highly irrational construc tions. The chief force in this terrain is fantasy and its landmarks include stories, myths, jokes, gossip, nicknames, graffiti and cartoons. In the organizational dreamworld, emotions prevail over rationality and pleasure over reality. The paper argues that fantasy offers a third possibility to organizational members, which amounts to neither conformity nor rebellion, but to a grudging material acceptance accompanied by a symbolic refashioning of events and official stor ies. Far from being a marginal terrain, it is suggested that the unmanaged organisation is rich, multidimensional and the natural habitat of subjectivity. Four different modes of subjectivity are identified and discussed in connection with different types of organizational narratives: (1) the subject as hero; (2) the subject as heroic survivor; (3) the subject as victim; (4) the subject as object of love.",2-s2.0-84970370509,3,1995,Organization Studies,0

It is widely assumed that older adults suffer a deficit in the psychological processes that underlie remembering of contextual or source information. This conclusion is based in large part on empirical interactions, including disordinal ones, that reveal differential effects of manipulations of memory strength on recognition in young and old subjects. This article lays out an alternative theory that takes as a starting point the overwhelming evidence from the psychometric literature that the effects of age on memory share a single mediating influence. Thus, the theory assumes no differences between younger and older subjects other than a global difference in memory fidelity-that is, the older subjects are presumed to have less valid representations of events and objects than are young subjects. The theory is articulated through 3 major assumptions and implemented in a computational model, DRYAD, to simulate fundamental results in the literature on aging and recognition, including the very interactions taken to imply selective impairment in older people.

This study, which examines businesses competing in the U.S. packaged software industry in the 1990s, shows that increasing industry concentration raises the stakes surrounding market positions and leads to greater interdependence of innovation strategies in an industry-including interactions both with competitors and with other players in a larger system of complementary products. As concentration increases, therefore, organizations are less driven by historical patterns of innovation and become increasingly responsive to innovations by both types of external actors.",2-s2.0-77956991200,3,2010,Organization Science,0

In reply, I argue that psychophysical principles are not violated and that a quantitative theory of criterion placement is currently outside the scope of the diffusion model and many other models of memory.

This article examines the scientific utility of the concept of free will. Distinctions are drawn between the concepts of hard determinism, soft determinism, libertarianism, conscious choice, beliefs about conscious control, volitional behavior, and actual personal control. Relevant theories reviewed include Zavalloni's feedback theory, Rychlak's telosponse theory, Tageson's three-dimensional model, Sperry's theory of supervenient control, Bandura's theory of agency, and the chaos concept. Data relevant to these theories are reviewed. It is concluded that theories of free will can be compatible with the scientific tasks of prediction and control. However, the free will vs. determinism issue is unlikely to be resolved conclusively by using scientific data.

Assuming that migration threat is multi-dimensional, this article seeks to investigate how various types of threats associated with immigration affect attitudes towards immigration and civil liberties. Through experimentation, the study unpacks the 'securitization of migration' discourse by disaggregating the nature of immigration threat, and its impact on policy positions and ideological patterns at the individual level. Based on framing and attitudinal analysis, we argue that physical security in distinction from cultural insecurity is enough to generate important ideological variations stemming from strategic input (such as framing and issue-linkage). We expect then that as immigration shifts from a cultural to a physical threat, immigration issues may become more politically salient but less politicized and subject to consensus. Interestingly, however, the findings reveal that the effects of threat framing are not ubiquitous, and may be conditional upon ideology. Liberals were much more susceptible to the frames than were conservatives. Potential explanations for the ideological effects of framing, as well as their implications, are explored.",2-s2.0-84865431389,5,2012,Political Behavior,0

On the basis of a new data set of more than 45,000 individual state legislator sessions (1988-2012), I document how agenda control is deemed valuable to legislators and groups seeking influence on policy. Employing a difference-in-differences design, I assess the revealed price, as measured by campaign contributions, that firms are willing to pay for access to committee and party leaders and document how this price varies across industries and institutions. The results indicate that industries systematically funnel money to the legislative agenda setters by whom they are regulated, and to those endowed with important procedural powers. I document that the value of agenda-setter positions has increased dramatically in recent years. Finally, exploiting changes in state laws, I show that relaxing contribution limits significantly benefits committee chairs and party leaders more so than it does other legislators, suggesting that agenda setters have strong incentives to obstruct restrictive campaign finance reforms.",2-s2.0-85026323168,5,2017,American Journal of Political Science,0

To the contrary, this article asserts that archival region and time period studies are inconsistent themselves, that most of them are inadequate for testing curvilinearity, and that some of them are consistent with curvilinearity. Moreover, concomitant lab and field studies also provide evidence for a curvilinear relationship that is as robust as the linear relationship ostensibly is in archival studies.

Internet access and use in Britain has remained by and large concentrated in wealthier households, underlining, at an aggregate level, a clear link between individuals' socio-economic background and their use of the internet.A somewhat contradictory statement emerges, however, from recent claims made by techno-enthusiasts, and apparently young people themselves, about the existence of a digital generation.This generational label suggests that young people today are, irrespective of their background, growing up with a sense of digital expertise, where class boundaries have become obscured. The article discusses this apparent contradiction, based on a study of young internet users.The findings suggest that, while class boundaries can be affected by internet use, the impact of this use remains nonetheless short lived and unlikely to significantly impinge on young people's social mobility in the future.

When the two eyes view discrepant monocular stimuli, stable single vision gives way to alternating periods of monocular dominance; this is the well-known but little understood phenomenon of binocular rivalry. This article develops a neural theory of binocular rivalry that treats the phenomenon as the default outcome when binocular correspondence cannot be established. The theory posits the existence of monocular and binocular neurons arrayed within a functional processing module, with monocular neurons playing a crucial role in signaling the stimulus conditions instigating rivalry and generating inhibitory signals to implement suppression. Suppression is conceived as a local process happening in parallel over the entire cortical representation of the binocular visual field. The strength of inhibition causing suppression is related to the size of the pool of monocular neurons innervated by the suppressed eye, and the duration of a suppression phase is attributed to the strength of excitation generated by the suppressed stimulus. The theory is compared with three other contemporary theories of binocular rivalry. The article closes with a discussion of some of the unresolved problems related to the theory.",2-s2.0-0024489054,6,1989,Psychological Review,0

The essay describes, at length, Afghanistan's internal politics and foreign relations from the eighteenth century until the present The historical discussion, which emphasizes the post-World War II period, relies primarily on US government documents. The essay concludes, based on the information presented, that the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan reluctantly, and that it did not invade primarily in order to expand its influence. It also concludes that the USSR has not gamed major strategic advantages from its occupation of Afghanistan. Finally, the essay reconsiders the theories of Soviet strategy, and notes that the facts of the Afghan case generally contradict the 'grand strategy' theorists, while they support the views of Kennan.",2-s2.0-84965572219,5,1987,Journal of Peace Research,0

We examine the procurement process selection problem of a large industrial buyer who employs reverse auctions for awarding procurement contracts. We contrast two classes of commonly used strategies under multiple sourcing; namely, single-stage reverse auctions, and two-stage processes where price-quantity adjustments between the buyer and the suppliers follow a first-stage reverse auction. Deriving bounds of efficiency for these two classes of procurement processes under convex supplier production costs, we present insights on the conditions under which each class is preferable for the buyer. Considering the effect of contracting and processing costs, a single-stage process is likely to be preferable to a two-stage process when the number of bidding suppliers is high, especially when capacity is rigid. A two-stage process with one information transfer in the second stage may be the preferred procurement mode when production is highly scalable, i.e., when the marginal production cost increase with increased production is small. When the number of suppliers is low, the effect of a decrease in production scalability depends on the current scalability level. For high scalability levels, a decrease in production scalability may decrease the efficiency of both single-stage and simple two-stage processes, whereas for low scalability levels, it tends to increase efficiency for both of these process classes. A decrease in production costs makes employing simple processes more attractive when production is highly scalable or when supplier capacity is rigid. For intermediate production scalability, however, a cost decrease may make employing two-stage processes with multiple information transfers in the second round preferable for the buyer.",2-s2.0-67649921429,3,2009,Management Science,0

Results from four studies, covering a variety of decision domains, indicate that chronic imagery vividness rarely amplifies the effects of vivid and salient information. Imagery vividness may, in fact, attenuate the effects of vivid and salient information. This is because, relative to nonvivid imagers, vivid imagers rely less on information that appears obvious and rely more on information that seems less obvious. This tendency is so robust that vividness of imagery may amplify the effects of vivid information only when this information is the only information available in the decision field.

The article examines the relations among illicit drugs, violence, and the state, focusing on why certain drugs are prohibited whereas others are not. The moral concerns underlying prohibition and the stereotyping of drug users along racial and class lines historically and in the present are reviewed. One conclusion is that modern states use drug prohibition as a way of defining the moral and social boundaries of exclusion and inclusion. In this definition, medical treatment and public health considerations play an auxiliary role. Other conclusions are the inflexibility of the international drug control regime and the need to consider experiments in drug legalization. Inflexibility, economic globalization, and worldwide drug trafficking have perverse consequences, which vary with the institutional capacity of states. The rise of incarceration and other forms of violence are particularly evident in economically and socially marginal communities and where the authority of states is weakened by internal corruption and external conflict.

Negations (e.g., ""Jim is not guilty"") are part of our daily language and communication. Linguistic and non-linguistic negations can occur when receivers counter-argue what communicators are saying, when hypotheses are disconfirmed, or through negative cognitive responses and many other social interactive processes. Our study explores how negations are encoded by considering the predictions of two theoretical models. According to the fusion model, the core of a negated message and the negation marker are integrated into one meaningful unit. Thus, Jim in the example might be encoded within the schema ""innocence."" According to the schema-plus-tag model, a negated message is represented as a core supposition and a negation tag, allowing for dissociation of the two at a later point in time. We compare the two models by examining the nature of inferences that are facilitated by negations. Our results show that the existence of a schema that accommodates the meaning of the original negation is critical in determining how a negation will be encoded. When such a schema is not readily available, processing a negated message facilitates negation- incongruent associations, in line with predictions of the schema-plus-tag model. This model is also supported by analyses of respondents' memory.

Caloric density also correlated with the neural response to food pictures in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, a brain area that encodes the value of stimuli and predicts immediate consumption. That same region exhibited functional connectivity with an appetitive brain network, and this connectivity was modulated by willingness to pay. Despite the fact that participants were poor at explicitly judging caloric content, their willingness to pay and brain activity both correlated with actual caloric density.

Entrenched conceptions of masculinity have constructed the male body as bounded and controlled.

Drawing on data from participant-observation in Kraków, Poland, it is shown that the tour participants enact an embodied masculinity which is unruly and unrestrained.

This research note tests this and a related hypothesis, that defeat in war makes an authoritarian state's transition to democracy more likely. It uses Weibull event history models to analyze both the transition to and survival of democracy for states from 1960 to 1992, using the MID, COW, and Pearson/Baumann intervention data sets to measure international conflict. Important control variables such as economic prosperity are also included. It finds that lower levels of participation in international conflict do not facilitate democratic transition or survival, with the limited exception that participation in an international war blocks democratic transition. Also, in most models examined defeat in war does not make democratic transition more likely. The implications for liberalism are mixed: peace in general does not cause democracy, but spreading democracy is likely to spread peace.",2-s2.0-0035536316,5,2001,Journal of Politics,0

If the sought-for incorporation of virtue into liberal thought and practice today fails to grapple with these profound human concerns, in the first place by recognizing their existence, the language of virtue and its attendant moral sentiments will remain a matter more of scholarly debate than of lived practice.",2-s2.0-0036736713,5,2002,American Political Science Review,0

Although some theories suggest that anxious individuals selectively remember threatening stimuli, findings remain contradictory despite a considerable amount of research. A quantitative integration of 165 studies with 9,046 participants (clinical and nonclinical samples) examined whether a memory bias exists and which moderator variables influence its magnitude. Implicit memory bias was investigated in lexical decision/stimulus identification and word-stem completion paradigms; explicit memory bias was investigated in recognition and recall paradigms. Overall, effect sizes showed no significant impact of anxiety on implicit memory and recognition. Analyses indicated a memory bias for recall, whose magnitude depended on experimental study procedures like the encoding procedure or retention interval. Anxiety influenced recollection of previous experiences; anxious individuals favored threat-related information. Across all paradigms, clinical status was not significantly linked to effect sizes, indicating no qualitative difference in information processing between anxiety patients and high-anxious persons. The large discrepancy between study effects in recall and recognition indicates that future research is needed to identify moderator variables for avoidant and preferred remembering.",2-s2.0-56349121968,6,2008,Psychological Bulletin,0

A typical (roughly) two-digit industry in the United States appears to have constant or slightly decreasing returns to scale. Three puzzles emerge, however. First, estimates often rise at higher levels of aggregation. Second, apparent decreasing returns contradicts evidence of only small economic profits. Third, estimates with value added differ substantially from those with gross output. A representative-firm paradigm cannot explain these puzzles, but a simple story of aggregation over heterogeneous units can. Theory and evidence on aggregation invalidate the common use of demand-side instruments.

Geographically dispersed sellers in electronic reverse marketplaces such as those hosted by market-makers like Ariba are uncertain about the number of competitors they face in any given market session. We refer to this uncertainty about the number of competitors as market-structure uncertainty. Over the course of several market sessions sellers learn about the competitive nature of the marketplace. How they learn to reduce the market-structure uncertainty depends on the market-transparency scheme, or the revelation policy adopted. A revelation policy determines the extent to which information-the number of sellers in a session, their bidding patterns, etc. - is revealed to sellers. Because these policies control what sellers learn and how they bid in future sessions, they determine buyer surplus. Possibly because market-structure uncertainty is more prevalent in information technology-enabled marketplaces than traditional ones, prior work has not addressed the impact of revelation policies on this type of uncertainty. Currently, there is little guidance available to buyers in choosing the appropriate revelation policy. To address this information-technology-enabled problem, we use game theory to compare the buyer surplus generated under a set of revelation policies commonly used in electronic reverse marketplaces. We demonstrate that the policy that generates the least amount of market-structure uncertainty for the sellers always maximizes buyer surplus. We further investigate to provide intuition regarding how bidders' reactions to overcome uncertainty differs with the nature of uncertainty, and how those reactions impact buyer surplus.",2-s2.0-38549123971,3,2007,Management Science,0

More high-quality candidates run when prospects appear to favor their party; they also win significantly more votes and victories than other candidates in equivalent circumstances. Thus, strategic career decisions both reflect and enhance national partisan tides.

In contrast with the majority of action theories in psychology and philosophy, a logical connection between action and intention is defended and, consequently, a causal relationship between action and intention is refuted. This is illustrated by reference to one of the most widely known and applied psychological action theories: the theory of planned behavior (I. Ajzen, 1991). However, the logical-connection argument can be circumvented if the existing research findings are reinterpreted as part of a psychology of intention.

Theories of metropolitan development in the United States explain that higher status populations tend to occupy newer housing while lower status groups tend to be restricted to older housing. The housing system thus reflects the broader stratification structure and likely changes in response to important shifts like the steep rise of income inequality at the end of the twentieth century. Indeed, a striking trend of increasingly large houses with many amenities emerged in U.S. metropolitan areas during this period, indicating that new construction may have become ever more exclusive and targeted to the affluent as inequality rose. In this article, I investigate whether the stratifying impact of new house construction intensified along with growing inequality and changing house structures using a variety of U.S. Census Bureau sources, examining both trends in the income level of new house buyers and the relationship of housing growth to affluent residential segregation. I find striking evidence that new housing did become much more dominated by the affluent, and was increasingly stratifying and segregating at the end of the twentieth century.

We examine this question by analyzing anti-nuclear norms, sometimes called the nuclear taboo, using an original survey experiment to evaluate American attitudes regarding nuclear use. We find that the public has only a weak aversion to using nuclear weapons and that this aversion has few characteristics of an unthinkable behavior or taboo. Instead, public attitudes about whether to use nuclear weapons are driven largely by consequentialist considerations of military utility. Americans' willingness to use nuclear weapons increases dramatically when nuclear weapons provide advantages over conventional weapons in destroying critical targets. Americans who oppose the use of nuclear weapons seem to do so primarily for fear of setting a negative precedent that could lead to the use of nuclear weapons by other states against the United States or its allies in the future.",2-s2.0-84874488456,5,2013,American Political Science Review,0

Studies of how parents influence children found that (1) increases in illegitimate fertility and divorce led to a large rise in the proportion of children living in 1-parent families, usually with the mother, and in stepfamilies; (2) children in families maintained by mothers, but not in stepfamilies, experience numberous social, economic, and psychological disadvantages; (3) contrary to the popular stereotype, white children in families maintained by mothers are more likely than black children in such families either to be living with or to receive financial assistance from extended family members; and (4) declining fertility and birth cohort size may have led to reductions in the welfare of children compared to the welfare of the elderly during the last 20 years. Studies of how children influence parents found that 1) the presence of at least 1 child probably reduced marital satisfaction; 2) the presence of a small number of children, especially preschool children, deters parental divorce; 3) children reduce remarriage probabilities for young mothers, but increase them for older mothers; and 4) at least the 1st and 2nd child probably reduce family income and savings. Studies of how childhood experiences affect individuals in adulthood find that 1) divorce of one's parents reduces one's own marriage probabilities and increases one's own divorce probabilities; 2) childhood stepfamilies have little effect on adult circumstances; 3) contrary to the popular stereotype children without siblings are not disadvantaged compared to other children; 4) an increasing number of siblings leads to reduced educational attainments; and 5) increasing educational mobility among men with small or medium numbers of siblings accounts for the increase observed for all men during this century. Recent projections suggest that 50-75% of the 1980 birth cohort may live in a 1-parent family during childhood, with a range of 40-70% for whites and a range of 85-95% for blacks.",2-s2.0-0022932494,7,1986,Annual Review of Sociology,0

1795,87231,Matsueda R.L.,The dynamics of moral beliefs and minor deviance,"The dynamics of moral beliefs and minor deviance. This paper examines the dynamic relationship between belief in conventional morality and minor forms of deviant behavior. It argues that social control theory offers a less-powerful explanation of deviance than cultural deviance perspectives because logically it cannot explain why persons select one deviant act over another. Nevertheless, control theory offers a more parsimonious conceptualization of belief and deviance, and therefore, if supported empirically, should be retained over competing theories. Drawing on this framework, a dynamic model of the reciprocal causal structure of belief and deviance is specified, and hypotheses about substantive and measurement processes are derived. A structural equation model for panel data allowing for response errors is estimated using the maximum likelihood estimator of Joreskog's LISREL approach. The data, drawn from the Youth in Transition Project, provide four waves of data on a national sample of tenth-grade boys. The results fail to replicate previous research, which found support for social control theory's stipulation of the relationship between belief and deviance. Contrary to previous results of cross-sectional studies, the effect of belief on deviance is relatively small and dwarfed by the effect of deviance on belief.",2-s2.0-84959796709,7,1989,Social Forces,0

This allows the construction of equilibrium pricing formulas while maintaining the same flexibility of state dynamics as in no-arbitrage models. In demonstrating the approach, the paper presents a model that incorporates inflation such that asset prices are nominal. The model takes advantage of the possibility of non-Gaussian shocks and model macroeconomic uncertainty as a jump-diffusion process. This leads to endogenous stock market crashes as stock prices drop to reflect a higher expected rate of return in response to sudden increases in risk. The nominal yield curve in this model has a positive slope if expected inflation growth negatively impacts real growth. This model also produces asset prices that are consistent with observed data, including a substantial equity premium at moderate levels of risk aversion.",2-s2.0-61849176532,3,2008,Management Science,0

Behavioural economists usually let agents' preferences change as a function of their endowments, treating the same person with different endowments as a set of distinct agents. Many properties of preferences then become immune to empirical test and it becomes impossible to judge whether an agent's decisions make the agent better or worse off. This impedes prediction of when decision rules are likely to change. SQM can alternatively be explained with unchanging preferences if preferences are incomplete.

We model trends between 1979 and 1989 in the work chances of unemployed people relativeto the chances of people in work. During the first half of the decade work chances of these two groups diverged, and though later economic recovery enabled young unemployed people to regain their 1979 position relative to young people in work, the relative work chances of older unemployed people were permanently impaired. These trends relate closely to employers' recruitment rates, and suggest that changes in the type of labour sought by employers have been particularly disadvantageous for older people, especially men.

This appears to be because nuclear-armed states expand their interests after nuclear acquisition rather than because nuclear weapons provide a shield behind which states can aggress against more powerful conventional-armed states. This calls into question conventional wisdom on the impact of nuclear weapons and has policy implications for the impact of nuclear proliferation.",2-s2.0-84921303262,5,2015,Journal of Conflict Resolution,0

The consequences of alliance formation for other foreign policies of a state, including defense spending and the initiation of militarized disputes, are examined using a theory of foreign policy that is based on several assumptions. First, states pursue two goods - change (defending those aspects of the status quo that one likes) and maintenance (altering those aspects of the status quo that one dislikes) - through their foreign policies. Second, states select a portfolio of policies designed to produce the most preferred mix of the two goods. Third, all foreign policy behavior, including alliance involvement, requires resources. Fourth, states are rational in their allocation of resources. Together, these imply that an observed alliance must have been the most efficient mechanism available for acquiring the most desired and achievable foreign policy portfolio and have implications for the observation of foreign policy substitutability. The empirical implications of this implication are tested, and results support the model: states are more active in their foreign policies after adding to their alliance portfolios - they increase their rate of conflict initiation, the capital intensiveness of their military establishments, and their defense spending.",2-s2.0-0037278828,5,2003,Journal of Conflict Resolution,0

Building upon a continuous-time model of search with Nash bargaining in a stationary environment, we analyze the effect of changes in minimum wages on labor market outcomes and welfare. Although minimum wage increases may or may not lead to increases in unemployment in our model, they can be welfare-improving to labor market participants on both the supply and demand sides of the labor market. We discuss identification of the model using Current Population Survey data on accepted wages and unemployment durations, and show that by incorporating a limited amount of information from the demand side of the market it is possible to obtain credible and precise estimates of all primitive parameters. We show that the optimal minimum wage in 1996 depends critically on whether or not contact rates can be considered to be exogenous and we note that the limited variation in minimum wages makes testing this assumption problematic.",2-s2.0-33745318657,2,2006,Econometrica,0

The latter are generated to overcome anticipated difficulties in three problem areas: initiation, implementation, and termination of an intended action. The action-guiding intention can be identified at various goal levels that relate to the alternative modes of implementation-imminent or wide-spanned goal representations. An ongoing action is controlled by a wide-spanned mode whenever implementation consists of automatized acts that require little or no conscious control. A wide-spanned goal representation facilitates the simultaneous execution of related or unrelated activity. The 2 control modes of narrow and wide goal span set the stage for the occurrence of action slips. A collection of various action slips can be categorized according to the 3 problem areas in the enactment of goal intentions: initiation, implementation, and termination slips.

Lakoff, 2002) and (b) moral intuitions (J. Haidt & C. Joseph, 2004). Content analysis of 12 key scenes in life stories showed that conservatives, as predicted, tended to depict authority figures as strict enforcers of moral rules and to identify lessons in self-discipline. By contrast, liberals were more likely to identify lessons learned regarding empathy and openness, even though (contrary to prediction) they were no more likely than conservatives to describe nurturant authority figures. Analysis of extended discourse on the development of religious faith and personal morality showed that conservatives emphasized moral intuitions regarding respect for social hierarchy, allegiance to in-groups, and the purity or sanctity of the self, whereas liberals invested more significance in moral intuitions regarding harm and fairness. The results are discussed in terms of the recent upsurge of interest among psychologists in political ideology and the value of using life-narrative methods and concepts to explore how politically active adults attempt to construct meaningful lives.",2-s2.0-54949138378,6,2008,Journal of Personality and Social Psychology,0

In this paper, we investigate the effects of negotiated exchanges in different network structures on the development of mutual trust. We derive hypotheses from various theories and test them by means of an experiment in which subjects first undertake a series of negotiated exchanges under different power conditions, and then face a trust problem with one of the actors that have been involved in the previous exchanges. The trust problem is operationalized by means of the Investment Game which allows us to look separately at trust and trustworthiness.

The authors simultaneously explored mediational effects of intergroup anxiety. Path analysis showed that cross-group friendships were associated with meta-attitudinally stronger and more accessible out-group attitudes, and the effects on all 3 criterion variables were mediated by intergroup anxiety.

The optimal policy can be written in feedback form, where the price at each point in time is selected so as to track the most stringent among all future milestones. Building on that observation, we propose a discrete-review policy that aims to dynamically track the appropriate milestone constraint and show that this simple and practical policy is near optimal in settings with large initial capacity and long sales horizons even in settings with no advance demand model information.

If the retrieval of the respective information is associated with difficulty, the impairment should be attenuated. The results of the present study confirm this hypothesis.

In the first category, implicit measures of disorder-relevant associations were consistent with explicit beliefs for some disorders (e.g., specific phobia), but for other disorders evidence was either mixed (e.g., panic disorder) or inconsistent with explicit beliefs (e.g., pain disorder). For substance use disorders and overeating, expected positive and unexpected negative associations with craved substances were found consistently. Contrary to expectation, implicit measures of self-esteem were consistently positive for patients with depressive disorder, social phobia, and body dysmorphic disorder. In the second category, short-term manipulations of disorder-relevant states generally affected implicit measures as expected. Therapeutic interventions affected implicit measures for one type of specific phobia, social phobia, and panic disorder, but not for alcohol use disorders or obesity. In the third category, implicit measures had predictive value for certain psychopathological behaviors, sometimes moderated by the availability of cognitive resources (e.g., for alcohol and food, only when cognitive resources were limited). The strengths of implicit measures include (a) converging evidence for dysfunctional beliefs regarding certain disorders and consistent new insights for other disorders and (b) prediction of some psychopathological behaviors that explicit measures cannot explain. Weaknesses include (a) that findings were inconsistent for some disorders, raising doubts about the validity of the measures, and (b) that understanding of the concept "" implicit"" is incomplete.",2-s2.0-78751561082,6,2011,Psychological Bulletin,0

Why are some firms more successful at introducing radical product innovations than others? Following Schumpeter (1942), many researchers have suggested that firm size is the key organizational predictor of radical product innovation. The authors provide an alternate view and argue that one key variable that differentiates firms with strong radical product innovation records from others is the firms' willingness to cannibalize their own investments. The authors identify three organizational factors that drive a firm's willingness to cannibalize. Results from a survey of three high-tech industries tend to support the alternate view that willingness to cannibalize is a more powerful driver of radical product innovation than firm size is.

The authors show that Bayesian algorithms are computationally simpler in frequency formats than in the probability formats used in previous research. Frequency formats correspond to the sequential way information is acquired in natural sampling, from animal foraging to neural networks. By analyzing several thousand solutions to Bayesian problems, the authors found that when information was presented in frequency formats, statistically naive participants derived up to 50% of all inferences by Bayesian algorithms.

Results of a laboratory experiment support our hypotheses, showing that an actor's power over another increases with the value of that actor's exchange with alternative partners.

Although it is natural for parents to value their children, some parents ""overvalue"" them, believing that their own children are more special and more entitled than other children are. This research introduces this concept of parental overvaluation. We developed a concise self-report scale to measure individual differences in parental overvaluation, the Parental Overvaluation Scale (POS; Study 1). The POS has high test-retest stability over 6, 12, and 18 months (Study 2). As demonstrated in a representative sample of Dutch parents (Study 3) and a diverse sample of American parents (Study 4), the POS has an internally consistent single-factor structure; strong measurement invariance across sexes; as well as good convergent, discriminant, and criterion validity. Overvaluation is especially high in narcissistic parents (Studies 3, 4, 6). When parents overvalue their child, they overclaim their child's knowledge (Study 4), perceive their child as more gifted than actual IQ scores justify (Study 5), want their child to stand out from others, and frequently praise their child in real-life settings (Study 6). By contrast, overvaluation is not consistently related to parents' basic parenting dimensions (i.e., warmth and control) or Big Five personality traits (Studies 3, 4, 6). Importantly, overvalued children are not more intelligent or better performing than other children (Studies 5-6). These findings support the validity of the POS and show that parental overvaluation has important and unique implications for parents' beliefs and practices. Research on overvaluation might shed light on the determinants of parenting practices and the socialization of children's self-views, including narcissism.",2-s2.0-84926292456,6,2015,Journal of Personality and Social Psychology,0

The growth of catalog sales and the enormous potential of e-commerce elevates the importance of understanding remote purchase. Remote purchase environments differ from traditional bricks- and-mortar purchases in that the purchase decision is more likely to be framed as two separate decisions: consumers' decisions to order and, upon receipt, their decisions to keep or return the item. These two decisions are separated by a period of time, and crucial experiential information often is available only at the second decision point (i.e., after receipt). Consumers' initial lack of experiential information makes product choice more risky. Return policy leniency is one way to minimize the inherent consumer risk, but retailers may avoid instituting overtly lenient policies because they expect increased return rates. However, the endowment effect suggests some surprising benefits of return policy leniency to the retailer.

Standard models of employment fluctuations cannot reconcile the unemployment rate's remarkable persistence with the high job-finding rates found in worker flows data. A matching model emphasizing high hazard rates among newly formed firm-worker matches can resolve this shortcoming. In the model, matches are experience goods; consequently, newly employed workers face higher hazard rates. Following a job loss, workers may experience several short-lived jobs before finding stable employment. At an aggregate level, an initial burst of job loss precipitates a steady flow of recurring job loss. A simulation shows that this recurring job loss can account for the fact that the unemployment rate remains elevated for as much as 4 or 5 years following an initial jump.",2-s2.0-0842290936,2,2004,Review of Economic Studies,0

Secondly, we show that people tend to talk about things that many would regard as unimportant, for example, cloning of headless frogs, eating less red meat, and so on. Given this, the connection between characteristics of discussion networks and achievement of instrumental ends - for example, getting a job or enhancing social support - is tenuous. Finally, we show that there is substantial topic-alter dependency. This dependency suggests that many substantive findings reported about, for example, gender differences in network composition might be an artifact of the data-collection instrument. Micro-level topic-alter dependencies reflect macro-level associations between attributes, topics, and roles. Consequently, cross-cultural comparison of GSS network questions is problematic.

Taking a socioecological perspective to psychology, which emphasizes the role of social habitats and their interactions with mind and behavior, we investigated regional variation in and correlates of an entrepreneurship-prone Big Five profile. Specifically, we analyzed personality data collected from over half a million U.S. residents (N = 619,397) as well as public archival data on state-level entrepreneurial activity (i.e., business-creation and self-employment rates). Results revealed that an entrepreneurship-prone personality profile is regionally clustered. This geographical distribution corresponds to the pattern that can be observed when mapping entrepreneurial activity across the United States. Indeed, the state-level correlation (N = 51) between an entrepreneurial personality structure and entrepreneurial activity was positive in direction, substantial in magnitude, and robust even when controlling for regional economic prosperity. These correlations persisted at the level of U.S. metropolitan statistical areas (N = 15) and were replicated in independent German (N = 19,842; 14 regions) and British (N = 15,617; 12 regions) samples.

In this paper we consider the effect these social cues have on online political information search and evaluation. Using processing-tracing software to monitor the patterns of information search and evaluation among our subjects, we find that social cues can function as a heuristic, allowing voters to reach judgments similar to those of their more informed counterparts.

1878,58615,Tezcür G.M.,When democratization radicalizes: The Kurdish nationalist movement in Turkey,"When democratization radicalizes: The Kurdish nationalist movement in Turkey. This article addresses a historical puzzle: Why did the insurgent PKK (Partiya Karkerê Kurdistan), which was militarily defeated, which renounced the goal of secession, and whose leader was under the custody of the Turkish state, remobilize its armed forces in a time when opportunities for the peaceful solution of the Kurdish question were unprecedented in Turkey? The PKK's radicalization at a period of EU-induced democratization in Turkey counters the conventional argument that fostering democracy would reduce the problems of ethnic conflict. Explanations based on resource mobilization, political opportunity structures, and cognitive framing fail to provide a satisfactory answer. The article argues that democratization will not necessarily facilitate the end of violent conflict as long as it introduces competition that challenges the political hegemony of the insurgent organization over its ethnic constituency. Under the dynamics of competition, the survival of the organization necessitates radicalization rather than moderation. As long as the insurgent organization successfully recruits new militants, democratization is not a panacea to violent conflict. The findings indicate that research on the micro-level dynamics of insurgency recruitment will contribute to a better understanding of ethnic conflict management. Data come from multiple sources including ethnographic fieldwork, statistical analyses of quantitative data (i.e. spatial clustering and ecological inference), and systematic reading of original documents.",2-s2.0-78649724805,5,2010,Journal of Peace Research,0

This research emically documents consumers' experience of the end of a favorite television series. Anchored in the domain of evolving narrative brands, of which TV series are an archetypal example, this work draws from narrative theory, brand relationship theory, and basic research on interpersonal loss to document the processes of loss accommodation. The authors triangulate across data sources and methods (extended participant observation, long interview, and online forum analysis) to unfold the processes of loss accommodation triggered by brand discontinuation. Accommodation processes and postwithdrawal relationship trajectories depend upon the nature and closural force of the narrative inherent to the brand but also the sociality that surrounds its consumption. Consumption sociality allows access to transitive and connective resources that facilitate the processes of accommodation during critical junctures in consumer-brand relationships.",2-s2.0-84897732215,4,2014,Journal of Consumer Research,0

The properties of p-curves are commonly investigated by computer simulations. On the basis of these simulations, it has been proposed that the skewness of this curve can be used as a diagnostic tool to decide whether the significant p values within a certain domain of research suggest the presence of p-hacking or actually demonstrate that there is a true effect. Here we introduce a rigorous mathematical approach that allows the properties of p-curves to be examined without simulations. This approach allows the computation of a p-curve for any statistic whose sampling distribution is known and thereby allows a thorough evaluation of its properties. For example, it shows under which conditions p-curves would exhibit the shape of a monotone decreasing function. In addition, we used weighted distribution functions to analyze how 2 different types of publication bias (i.e., cliff effects and gradual publication bias) influence the shapes of p-curves. The results of 2 survey experiments with more than 1,000 participants support the existence of a cliff effect at p = .05 and also suggest that researchers tend to be more likely to recommend submission of an article as the level of statistical significance increases beyond this p level. This gradual bias produces right-skewed p-curves mimicking the existence of real effects even when no such effects are actually present.

How consumers decode conspicuous consumption cues in buyer-seller relationships. Little empirical consumer research has focused on the decoding of conspicuous symbolism, that is, the inferences consumers make about others' conspicuous consumption. Grounded in theory on social perception and role congruity, four experiments show that consumer inferences about and behavioral intentions toward conspicuous sellers are moderated by communal and exchange relationship norms. Specifically, conspicuous consumption by a seller decreases warmth inferences and, in turn, behavioral intentions toward the seller under the communal norm; conversely, it increases competence inferences and, in turn, behavioral intentions under the exchange norm. A seller's mere wealth triggers similar inferences, suggesting that conspicuous consumption is a surrogate for actual wealth. Priming consumers with persuasion knowledge inhibits the inferential benefits resulting from conspicuousness under the exchange norm. These findings reveal the theoretically meaningful role of the consumption context by showing that consumers' warmth and competence inferences operate differentially in commercial relationships as a result of salient communal versus exchange norms, with important consequences for consumers' behavioral intentions.",2-s2.0-84879198752,4,2013,Journal of Marketing Research,0

The study puts forth a theoretical framework for explaining the ways in which political action groups use the mass media. Rooted in the resource mobilization approach to conflict, media strategy is determined by the extent of collective resources. The mass media is seen as one of several alternative arenas of conflict through which groups attempt to influence the government. Compared to other more institutional arenas, access to the media is a relatively inexpensive alternative for small, unorganized groups. A more detailed understanding of media strategy comes through an analysis of the attempts of group leaders to meet specific groups needs and minimize particular risks. A participant-observation was carried out, involving three different action groups that were active during the Israeli withdrawal from Sinai. While all of the group leaders attempted to maximize collective rewards, their particular set of collective resources and needs were reflected in both the type of group risks they encountered and the media strategies they developed to minimize those risks.",2-s2.0-84965537958,5,1984,Journal of Conflict Resolution,0

First, the optimal plan is shown to respond to a country's temptation to leave the union by tilting both current and future policy in its favour. This yields a non-linear rule according to which each country weight in policy decisions is timevarying and depends on its incentive to abandon the union. Second, we show that there might be conditions such that a break-up of the union, as has occurred in some historical episodes, is efficient.

New forms of work organization have spread throughout much of the corporate world. Critics warn that team systems may encourage workers to internalize managerial definitions of their work situations, and - as a result - strengthen management's hegemony over them. This article presents an ethnographic analysis of four manufacturing plants in which team initiatives have been introduced. The findings cast doubt on the hegemony thesis. Analyzing data bearing on the degree of managerial legitimacy, the salience of class boundaries, and instances of worker defiance in both traditional- and team-based production areas, I find only occasional evidence of increased worker integration or incorporation within a nascent managerial regime. Indeed, by drawing attention to the limited authority that workers were actually allowed, team systems tended to heighten worker suspicion and distrust and to foster patterns of solidarity that were difficult for managers to control. The most significant feature of the new production concepts may not be their siren-like appeal, but rather the tensions and contradictions they introduce into work organizations. In fact, such concepts provide workers with subtle yet strategic resources with which to renegotiate the boundaries of managerial authority.",2-s2.0-0037841786,7,2003,Social Problems,0

Attention is focused on formulating and testing three rival blockmodels for the rice trading networks. Established blockmodels have clear substantive interpretations.

As a result, competition authorities have shown considerable interest in the evolution of sports broadcast rights on both continents. In the United States, attention has been focused on professional and amateur (intercollegiate) leagues alike, while in Europe most attention has been given to the relationship between broadcasting and various countries' professional soccer leagues. The recent attempt by the United Kingdom's leading pay-television operator; BSkyB, to purchase the leading soccer club, Manchester United, has changed the tone if not the substance of broadcast sports rights negotiations in the United Kingdom and, perhaps, throughout Europe. This paper focuses upon the competition and efficiency issues involved in the granting of broadcast rights by sports teams or leagues and their resolution on both sides of the Atlantic. What are the consequences of collective (and exclusive) selling by sports leagues of their broadcast rights? Does the control of sports broadcast rights allow the broadcaster to leverage its position and increase its monopoly power? Can leagues foreclose entry by competitors through widespread sale of broadcast rights to local or national broadcasters? Can ownership of sports teams by broadcasters have anti-competitive effects? Although we do not offer any new insights on these well-researched theoretical issues, we provide evidence to suggest that such problems are much less acute in the United States than in Europe.

We examine Democrats' decline in the House of Representatives from the mid-1930s to the late 1940s. Debates over American exceptionalism in the realm of social policy pay surprisingly little attention to a profound transformation that occurred during and after World War II: on the international stage, the United States emerged as the hegemon; at home, the Pentagon became the largest and most powerful agency in the federal bureaucracy. In modeling electoral losses suffered by Democrats, we show that World War II mobilization played an important role. First, Democrats lost ground in congressional districts where the nascent military-industrial complex was created, specifically in aircraft manufacturing centers. Second, the impact of aircraft manufacturing intersected with wartime in-migration of non-whites. Democrats suffered significantly greater losses where both non-white population and aircraft manufacturing employment increased.

Whereas most accounts of the rise and fall of the New Deal emphasize different aspects of domestic processes, we demonstrate that militarism and expansion of national security agencies undermined congressional support at a critical juncture. This intersection of wartime mobilization and social policy-and not an inherent and enduring institutional impediment to social welfare-contributed to under-development of the welfare state and abandonment of universal social welfare programs in the United States.",2-s2.0-78049268590,7,2010,American Sociological Review,0

Although marketers increasingly rely upon cause-related marketing strategies to increase sales, controversy exists regarding whether a retailer should partner with causes offering high or low fit levels with its core business practices. The present investigation extends prior research by examining how retailer-cause fit affects consumer evaluations of retailers' cause-related marketing strategies. The results indicate that the effects of retailer-cause fit are moderated by consumer perceptions of the retailer's motive for engaging in cause-related marketing (Study 1), by the affinity that consumers hold for the social cause component of the campaign (Study 2), as well as by the interactive effects associated with the two moderators (Study 3).",2-s2.0-36348982706,4,2007,Journal of Retailing,0

Marina Abramovic Organizing the Unfinished Business of Arthur Schopenhauer. Performance is a way of organising for value creation. The kind of value performance art aims to generate is neither use-nor exchange-value but aesthetic value, philosophically defined as searching for ‘the absolute’. Philosophical asthetics, from Kant to Schopenhauer and Nietzsche, thus claims that art is the modem gateway to metaphysics. Pictures, texts and other artefacts are spin-offs of artists main function; performing the absolute. This paper illustrates this philosophical position by taking three practical examples which show how the artists Hans Makart, Herman Nitsch and Marina Abramovic three famous performance art managers - go about organizing the supply of an art to satisfy a demand for metaphysics.",2-s2.0-84990354069,3,1999,Organization Studies,0

An assessment of parole versus fixed-sentence regimes. Over the past 30 years, many states have abolished parole boards, which traditionally have had the discretion to release inmates before the expiration of their full sentence, in favor of fixed-sentence regimes in which the original sentence is binding. However, if prison time lowers recidivism risk and if parole boards can accurately estimate inmates' recidivism risk, then relative to a fixed-sentence regime, parole can provide allocative-efficiency benefits (costly prison space is allocated to the highest-risk offenders) and incentive benefits (prisoners know they must reduce their recidivism risk to gain an early release, so invest in their own rehabilitation). Exploiting quasiexperiments from the state of Georgia, I show that prison time reduces recidivism risk and that parole boards set prison time in an allocatively efficient manner. Prisoners respond to these incentives; after a reform that eliminated parole for certain offenders, they accumulated a greater number of disciplinary infractions, completed fewer prison rehabilitative programs, and recidivated at higher rates than inmates unaffected by the reform. I estimate that eliminating parole for all prisoners would increase the prison population by 10% while also increasing the crime rate through deleterious effects on recidivism.",2-s2.0-84873572705,2,2013,Quarterly Journal of Economics,0

The present study provides evidence that preferences for these different strategies depend on negotiator role and personal orientation. In a price negotiation, buyers and prevention-focused individuals prefer vigilant strategies, whereas sellers and promotion-focused individuals prefer eager strategies. When there is a match between the strategy and the role (role-strategy fit) or between the strategy and the individual's regulatory focus orientation (focus-strategy fit), the negotiator experiences more fit and plans to be more demanding in the negotiation. By manipulating strategy in a real, binding negotiation, we reveal its importance in determining negotiators' subjective experiences and planned demand.

A common assumption underlying the analysis of consumers' choices among optional tariffs is that consumers choose the tariff that maximizes their surplus and, thus, the tariff that leads to the lowest billing rate for a given amount of usage. Yet there is evidence that many users prefer a flat rate even though their billing rate would be lower with a pay-per-use tariff (flat-rate bias), and some users prefer a pay-per-use tariff even though they would save money with a flat rate (pay-per-use bias). The authors conduct four empirical analyses based on three different data sets. They show that the flat-rate bias is more important and has a greater regularity and time persistence than the pay-per-use bias. They classify potential causes of the flat-rate bias as ""insurance effect,"" ""taxi meter effect,"" ""convenience effect,"" and ""overestimation effect"" and show that the insurance, the taxi meter, and the overestimation effects lead to a flat-rate bias. They provide evidence that underestimation of usage is a major cause of the pay-per-use bias. They show that the flat-rate bias does not significantly increase customer churn and thus results in a short- and long-term profit increase. In contrast, the pay-per-use bias largely increases churn so that in the long run, the additional short-term profit is offset by higher churn.",2-s2.0-33744510444,4,2006,Journal of Marketing Research,0

The results indicate that awareness of a social presence during purchase selection and commitment, whether real or imagined, is a motivating factor in creating embarrassment for the consumer. Further, our results show that the more familiar consumers are with an embarrassing product purchase, the less embarrassed they are likely to feel. Familiarity with an embarrassing product purchase is also shown to have implications for the effect of social presence. That is, familiarity with purchase acts as a moderator for the relationship of real social presence and embarrassment by reducing the influence of the social presence. In the context of an imagined social presence, purchase familiarity is shown to reduce the likelihood of imagining.

Our first result identifies a novel externality that can precipitate war: price-taking firms fail to internalize the impact of their extraction on military action. In the case of inelastic resource demand, war incentives increase over time and war may become inevitable. Our second result shows that in some situations, regulation of prices and quantities by the resource-rich country can prevent war, and when this is the case, there will also be slower resource extraction than the Hotelling benchmark (with inelastic demand).

Moreover, studies that investigate the influence of compulsory voting laws on electoral participation generally treat these policies monolithically, with scant attention to the nuances that differentiate mandatory voting laws across systems and to their consequences for voting rates. Analyses that explicitly and empirically examine the effects of penalties and enforcement are surprisingly rare. This study aims to fill that void by adapting rational choice models of participation in elections for compulsory voting systems.

Focusing on the first decade of the twentieth century-in many respects for labor, a period not unlike the present-I seek to explain the pattern of organizing success and failure across industries and occupations. I find that the most organized settings occurred where workers had greater disruptive capacities due to the high cost of being replaced during work stoppages. The highest replacement costs were associated with three conditions: scarcity of skilled labor, geographically isolated worksites that raised the cost of importing strikebreakers, and time-sensitive tasks that rendered replacement workers economically impractical. Workplaces that had at least one of these conditions formed the backbone of the early U.S. labor movement.

Dyad members exposed to numerical judgments made by peers gave significantly less weight to those judgments than did individuals working alone. This difference in willingness to use peer input was mediated by the greater confidence that the dyad members reported in the accuracy of their own estimates. Furthermore, dyads were no better at judging the relative accuracy of their own estimates and the advisor's estimates than individuals were.

After observing aggregate sales in prior periods, firms post prices for their unsold output. In each period, the demand of a new batch of consumers is randomly activated. Existing customers who have not yet bought and then new customers arrive at the market in random order, observe the posted prices, and either purchase at the lowest available price or delay their purchase decision. We construct a sequential equilibrium in which the output produced and its allocation across consumers is efficient. Thus consumers endogenously sort themselves efficiently, with the highest valuations purchasing first. Transaction prices in each period rise continuously, as firms become more optimistic about demand, followed by a market correction.

Majority cycling and related social choice paradoxes are often thought to threaten the meaningfulness of democracy. Deliberation can protect against majority cycles - not by inducing unanimity, which is unrealistic, but by bringing preferences closer to single-peakedness. We present the first empirical test of this hypothesis, using data from Deliberative Polls. Comparing preferences before and after deliberation, we find increases in proximity to single-peakedness. The increases are greater for lower- versus higher-salience issues and for individuals who seem to have deliberated more versus less effectively. They are not merely a by-product of increased substantive agreement (which in fact does not generally increase). Our results are important, quite apart from their implications for majority cycling, because single-peakedness can be naturally interpreted in terms of an underlying issue dimension, which can both clarify the debate and allow a majority-winning alternative to be interpreted as a median choice and thus as an attractive compromise.

This paper develops theoretical foundations for an error analysis of approximate equilibria in dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models with heterogeneous agents and incomplete financial markets. While there are several algorithms that compute prices and allocations for which agents' first-order conditions are approximately satisfied (""approximate equilibria""), there are few results on how to interpret the errors in these candidate solutions and how to relate the computed allocations and prices to exact equilibrium allocations and prices. We give a simple example to illustrate that approximate equilibria might be very far from exact equilibria. We then interpret approximate equilibria as equilibria for close-by economies; that is, for economies with close-by individual endowments and preferences. We present an error analysis for two models that are commonly used in applications, an overlapping generations (OLG) model with stochastic production and an asset pricing model with infinitely lived agents. We provide sufficient conditions that ensure that approximate equilibria are close to exact equilibria of close-by economies. Numerical examples illustrate the analysis.",2-s2.0-27844536224,2,2005,Econometrica,0

The authors develop and test a new model of store choice behavior whose basic premise is that each shopper is more likely to visit the store with the lowest total shopping cost. The total shopping cost is composed of fixed and variable costs. The fixed cost is independent of, whereas the variable cost depends on, the shopping list (i.e., the products and their respective quantities to be purchased). Besides travel distance, the fixed cost includes a shopper's inherent preference for the store and historic store loyalty. The variable cost is a weighted sum of the quantities of items on the shopping list multiplied by their expected prices at the store. The article has three objectives: (1) to model and estimate the relative importance of fixed and variable shopping costs, (2) to investigate customer segmentation in response to shopping costs, and (3) to introduce a new measure (the basket size threshold) that defines competition between stores from a shopping cost perspective. The model controls for two important phenomena: Consumer shopping lists might differ from the collection of goods ultimately bought, and shoppers might develop category-specific store loyalty.",2-s2.0-0032367374,4,1998,Journal of Marketing Research,0

High school education is central to adolescent socialization and has important downstream consequences for adult life. However, scholars examining schooling's political effects have struggled to reconcile education's correlation with both more liberal social attitudes and greater income. To disentangle this relationship, I exploit a major school leaving age reform in Great Britain that caused almost half the population to remain at high school for at least an additional year. Using a fuzzy regression discontinuity design, I find that each additional year of late high school increases the probability of voting Conservative in later life by 12 percentage points. A similar relationship holds when pooling all cohorts, suggesting that high school education is a key determinant of voting behavior and that the reform could have significantly altered electoral outcomes.

In this experiment, we used virtual reality to investigate whether manipulating visual proprioceptive cues could alter movement-evoked pain in 24 people with neck pain. We hypothesized that pain would occur at a lesser degree of head rotation when visual feedback overstated true rotation and at a greater degree of rotation when visual feedback understated true rotation. Our hypothesis was clearly supported: When vision overstated the amount of rotation, pain occurred at 7% less rotation than under conditions of accurate visual feedback, and when vision understated rotation, pain occurred at 6% greater rotation than under conditions of accurate visual feedback.

Belongingness appears to have multiple and strong effects on emotional patterns and on cognitive processes.

1974,41243,"Erat S., Kavadias S.",Sequential testing of product designs: Implications for learning,"Sequential testing of product designs: Implications for learning. Past research in new product development (NPD) has conceptualized prototyping as a ""design-build-testanalyze"" cycle to emphasize the importance of the analysis of test results in guiding the decisions made during the experimentation process. New product designs often involve complex architectures and incorporate numerous components, and this makes the ex ante assessment of their performance difficult. Still, design teams often learn from test outcomes during iterative test cycles enabling them to infer valuable information about the performances of (as yet) untested designs. We conceptualize the extent of useful learning from analysis of a test outcome as depending on two key structural characteristics of the design space, namely whether the set of designs are ""close"" to each other (i.e., the designs are similar on an attribute level) and whether the design attributes exhibit nontrivial interactions (i.e., the performance function is complex). This study explicitly considers the design space structure and the resulting correlations among design performances, and examines their implications for learning. We derive the optimal dynamic testing policy, and we analyze its qualitative properties. Our results suggest optimal continuation only when the previous test outcomes lie between two thresholds. Outcomes below the lower threshold indicate an overall low performing design space and, consequently, continued testing is suboptimal. Test outcomes above the upper threshold, on the other hand, merit termination because they signal to the design team that the likelihood of obtaining a design with a still higher performance (given the experimentation cost) is low. We find that accounting for the design space structure splits the experimentation process into two phases: the initial exploration phase, in which the design team focuses on obtaining information about the design space, and the subsequent exploitation phase in which the design team, given their understanding of the design space, focuses on obtaining a ""good enough"" configuration. Our analysis also provides useful contingency-based guidelines for managerial action as information gets revealed through the testing cycle. Finally, we extend the optimal policy to account for design spaces that contain distinct design subclasses.",2-s2.0-61849099827,3,2008,Management Science,0

When memory is inexact but people must report an exact value, they use estimation processes that combine the remembered stimulus value with category information. The proposed estimation processes include truncation at category boundaries and weighting with a central (prototypic) category value. These processes introduce bias in reporting even when memory is unbiased, but nevertheless may improve overall accuracy (by decreasing the variability of reports). Four experiments are presented in which people report the location of a dot in a circle. Subjects spontaneously impose horizontal and vertical boundaries that divide the circle into quadrants. They misplace dots toward a central (prototypic) location in each quadrant, as predicted by the model.

This article draws an analytical distinction between two types of market uncertainty: egocentric, which refers to a focal actor's uncertainty regarding the best way to convert a set of inputs to an output desired by a potential exchange partner, and altercentric, which denotes the uncertainty confronted by a focal actor's exchange partners regarding the quality of the output that the focal actor brings to the market. Given this distinction, the article considers how the value of ""structural holes"" and market status vary with these two types of uncertainty. The article proposes that the value of structural holes increases with egocentric uncertainty, but not with altercentric uncertainty. In contrast, the value of status increases with altercentric uncertainty, but declines with egocentric uncertainty. Thus actors with networks rich in structural holes should sort into markets or market segments that are high in egocentric uncertainty; high-status actors should sort into markets that are low in egocentric uncertainty. Support for this claim is found in an examination of the venture capital markets.",2-s2.0-0035402977,7,2001,American Journal of Sociology,0

We present the case for a role of biologically plausible neural network modeling in bridging the gap between physiology and behavior. We argue that spiking-level networks can allow "" vertical"" translation between physiological properties of neural systems and emergent "" whole-system"" performance-enabling psychological results to be simulated from implemented networks and also inferences to be made from simulations concerning processing at a neural level. These models also emphasize particular factors (e.g., the dynamics of performance in relation to real-time neuronal processing) that are not highlighted in other approaches and that can be tested empirically. We illustrate our argument from neural-level models that select stimuli by biased competition. We show that a model with biased competition dynamics can simulate data ranging from physiological studies of single-cell activity (Study 1) to whole-system behavior in human visual search (Study 2), while also capturing effects at an intermediate level, including performance breakdown after neural lesion (Study 3) and data from brain imaging (Study 4). We also show that, at each level of analysis, novel predictions can be derived from the biologically plausible parameters adopted, which we proceed to test (Study 5). We argue that, at least for studying the dynamics of visual attention, the approach productively links single-cell to psychological data.",2-s2.0-79251497006,6,2011,Psychological Review,0

Four-person groups attempted to reach unanimous agreement on four high- and four low-importance 6-point attitudinal scales. Continuous monitoring of each group member's current position permitted a social transition scheme (STS) analysis of a number of process questions which arise when groups must choose among several ordered alternatives. Members of extreme factions, members of submajority plurality factions, and nearby factions exerted greater attraction than moderate factions, members of subplurality factions, and distant factions, respectively. The latter effect was attributable, in part, to majority factions making small concessions to distant minority factions to prompt reciprocation and progress toward concensus. Groups were more likely to reach unanimous agreement and comparable shifts in opinion occurred more rapidly on the less important issues than on the more important issues. However, the present within-groups manipulation of issue importance exerted little effect on the group decision-making process.

In this article, an equilibrium theory of conflict behavior is developed in which there exists a balance or equilibrium in the number of disputes begun and ended in a given time period. Significant interdependence as the result of diffusion, reinforcement, or a common source of conflict behavior leads to departures from the equilibrium model that, in turn, are associated with the onset of systemic, or global, war. Using a set of serious international disputes occurring in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the nineteenth century is found to fit the equilibrium model, but the period approaching World War I does not, when all disputes involving both major and minor powers are considered. Disputes involving only major powers constitute a stable system in both the nineteenth century and pre-World War I period. Implications for crisis management and conflict resolution are developed through the use of disjoint sets that effectively separate the different kinds of disputes, which together could lead to global war.",2-s2.0-84965404727,5,1984,Journal of Conflict Resolution,0

To extricate the inherently confounded factors of maturation, cultural change, and generational differences, life-span methodologists have proposed a variety of analytic designs and interpretative decision rules. Recent critiques have shown that the proposed rules are inadequate and that there are logical limits to any such set of rules. A number of alternatives have been offered, most of which require the investigator to have strong, theoretically guided hypotheses and presume that the data conform strictly to the demands of the design. This article addresses the common situation in which data analysis is exploratory rather than hypothesis testing and in which the model is applied to data that only loosely meet the requirements of the design. In this case, aging, period, or cohort effects can be inferred if the researcher is willing to make appropriate restrictive assumptions and use scientific judgment rather than fixed decision rules. The application of judgmental principles is illustrated on 2 longitudinal data sets, and it is argued that the analytic designs are useful if intelligently applied and interpreted.

This article reports on an experiment comparing two methods for selecting national samples of blacks. The experiment was carried out as part of the 1982 General Social Survey (GSS). One sample was selected using area probability sampling with the selection probability for an area proportional to the size of its black population. The other sample was selected by sampling extra dwelling units in areas selected for the regular GSS. Although comparable in other respects, the two methods differed sharply in costs and statistical efficiency. The sample selected from the special black frame proved less expensive to interview and required fewer screening interviews in order to locate households with black members. The sample selected in the same areas as the regular GSS sample exhibited a smaller ""design effect""-probably because fewer respondents were selected from each sample area. The decision to use one method or the other to sample rare subgroups would depend on several factors, including the degree to which the subgroup is segregated, the amount of savings possible through piggybacking, and the relationship between screening and interviewing costs.",2-s2.0-0003818980,5,1985,Public Opinion Quarterly,0

In many situations, data are available at some aggregate level, but one wishes to estimate the individual-level association between a response and an explanatory variable (or variables). Unfortunately, this endeavor is fraught with difficulties because of the ecological level of the data. The only reliable approach for overcoming the inherent identifiability problem associated with the analysis of ecological data is to supplement the ecological data with individual-level data. In this article, the authors illustrate the benefits of gathering individual-level data in the context of a Poisson modeling framework. Additionally, they derive optimal designs that allow the individual samples to be chosen so that information with respect to a particular model is maximized. The methods are illustrated using Robinson’s classic data on illiteracy rates. The authors show that the optimal design, if used with an appropriate model, produces accurate inference with respect to estimation of relative risks, with ecological bias removed.",2-s2.0-84927709595,7,2014,Sociological Methodology,0

Sales promotions generate substantial short-term sales increases. To determine whether the sales promotion bump is truly beneficial from a managerial perspective, we propose a system of store-level regression models that decomposes the sales promotion bump into three parts: cross-brand effects (secondary demand), cross-period effects (primary demand borrowed from other time periods), and category-expansion effects (remaining primary demand). Across four store-level scanner datasets, we find that each of these three parts contribute about one third on average. One extension we propose is the separation of the category-expansion effect into cross-store and market-expansion effects. Another one is to split the cross-item effect (total across all other items) into cannibalization and between-brand effects. We also allow for a flexible decomposition by allowing all effects to depend on the feature/display support condition and on the magnitude of the price discount. The latter dependence is achieved by local polynomial regression. We find that feature-supported price discounts are strongly associated with cross-period effects while display-only supported price discounts have especially strong category-expansion effects. While the role of the category-expansion effect tends to increase with higher price discounts, the roles of cross-brand and cross-period effects both tend to decrease.",2-s2.0-4944223952,4,2004,Marketing Science,0

This is substantively important for two reasons. First, it demonstrates that certain sub-groups of the American public evaluate public policy proposals on the basis of their perceived “foreignness.” Second, it demonstrates that while nativism is traditionally associated with immigration and other race/ethnic-based policy preferences, it also affects attitudes toward other seemingly race-neutral policies in the United States.",2-s2.0-84890325339,5,2015,Political Behavior,0

Scholars who are pessimistic about the performance of diverse teams base their view on the hypothesis that decreased network density - the average strength of the relationship among team members - lowers a team's capacity for coordination. The optimistic view is founded on the hypothesis that teams that are characterized by high network heterogeneity, whereby relationships on the team cut across salient demographic boundaries, enjoy an enhanced learning capability. We test each of these hypotheses directly and thereby avoid the problematic assumption that they contradict one another. Our analysis of data on the social networks, organizational tenure, and productivity of 224 corporate R&D teams indicates that both network variables help account for team productivity.

In the cultural perspective laid out in this paper, marketing, by contrast, is described as a self-referential system of organizing that enables the organization to establish and maintain a flexible buffer between itself and the environment. Within this buffer, defined by marketing, the organization is able to display a high degree of adaptiveness while upholding and confirming itself.

In particular, it proposes a large-scale re-examination of the mobility experience - one which addresses the possibility that people make sense of social trajectories not just through 'objective' markers of economic or occupational success, but also through symbols and artifacts of class-inflected cultural identity. Such enquiry may yield a richer account that explains both the potential social benefits and the costs of mobility.",2-s2.0-84898895533,7,2014,Sociology,0

This paper addresses the general issue of whether the practice of investigating human decision making in hypothetical choice situations is at all warranted, or under what conditions. A particularly relevant factor that affects the match between real decisions and hypothetical decisions is the importance of a decision's consequences. In the literature experimental gambles tend to confound the reality of the decision situation with the size of the payoffs: hypothetical decisions tend to offer large payoffs, and real decisions tend to offer only small payoffs. Using the well-known framing effect (a tendency of risk-aversion for gains and of risk-seeking for losses) we find that the framing effect depends on payoff size but hypothetical choices match real choices for small as well as large payoffs. These results appear paradoxical unless size of incentive is clearly distinguished from the reality status of decision (real versus hypothetical). Since the field lacks a general theory of when hypothetical decisions match real decisions, the discussion presents an outline for developing such a theory.",2-s2.0-0036868492,3,2002,Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes,0

Working capital is an important indicator of firm operational efficiency. All else being equal, lower levels signal greater efficiency. Managers are thus likely to be motivated to report lower levels of working capital at times of greater external attention. We find that working capital levels decrease in the fourth fiscal quarter significantly more than expected, conditional on seasonal changes in economic activity. The decrease subsequently reverses in the following first fiscal quarter. Evidence indicates that firms manage down year-end working capital through transactions that increase year-end operating cash flow and that firms spread this activity over allworking capital accounts. Finally, the temporary decrease in year-end working capital is correlated with compensation benchmarks and analysts' annual cash flow forecasts. The temporary drop is also more pronounced for firms with industry dominance.",2-s2.0-85013684684,3,2017,Management Science,0

We introduce ""more altruistic than"" (MAT), a partial ordering over such preferences, and interpret it with known parametric models.

Several recent studies focus on two-player extensive form games of complete information in which the first mover (FM) chooses a more or less generous opportunity set for the second mover (SM). Here reciprocity can be formalized as the assertion that an MGT choice by the FM will elicit MAT preferences in the SM. A further assertion is that the effect on preferences is stronger for acts of commission by FM than for acts of omission. We state and prove propositions on the observable consequences of these assertions. Finally, empirical support for the propositions is found in existing data from investment and dictator games, the carrot and stick game, and the Stackelberg duopoly game and in new data from Stackelberg mini-games.",2-s2.0-37349063699,2,2008,Econometrica,0

The Coase conjecture (1972) is the proposition that a durable-goods monopolist, who sells over time and can quickly reduce prices as sales are made, will price at marginal cost. We show that an arbitrarily small deviation from Coase's assumptions - a deviation that applies in almost any practical application - results in the failure of that conjecture. In particular, we examine that conjecture in a model where there is a vanishingly small cost for production (or sales) capacity, and the seller may augment capacity in every period. In the ""gap case"", any positive capacity cost ensures that in the limit, as the size of the gap and the time between sales periods shrink, the monopolist obtains profits identical to those that would prevail when she could commit ex ante to a fixed capacity. Those profits are at least 29·8% of the full static monopoly optimum.",2-s2.0-36949019758,2,2008,Review of Economic Studies,0

However, the case also suggests that associations can be difficult to establish in large, complex industrial districts.

To stimulate sales of sustainable products, such as organic and fair trade products, retailers need to know whether their in-store instruments effectively enhance market shares. This study uses sales data and a multilevel modeling approach to explain the market shares of sustainable products according to shelf layout factors, price level, price promotions, and consumer demographics. It argues that the effect of these variables differs between organic versus fair trade products, as buying motives might differ, organic buyers tend to be more loyal, and price is a more informative signal of quality for organic products. Results show that the number of facings has a positive relationship with the market share of fair trade brands, but not with the market share of organic brands. The same holds for the price difference with the leading brand, which is important for fair trade brands but not for organic brands. In contrast, an arrangement of the product category by brand is associated with higher market share for organic brands but not for fair trade brands. Additionally, placement at eye level and clustering of items benefits both types of sustainable brands, whereas they appear to be not very sensitive to price promotions. Finally, higher sales of sustainable products are found in areas where the customer base is older and has a higher education level.",2-s2.0-84857632884,4,2012,Marketing Letters,0

Previous discussions of this discrepancy have considered responsible factors including differences in measurement error and use of nonlinear scales. In this article we demonstrate that the differential efficiency of experimental and field tests of interactions is also attributable to the differential residual variances of such interactions once the component main effects have been partialed out. We derive an expression for this residual variance in terms of the joint distribution of the component variables and explore how properties of the distribution affect the efficiency of tests of moderator effects. We show that tests of interactions in field studies will often have less than 20% of the efficiency of optimal experimental tests, and we discuss implications for the design of field studies.",2-s2.0-0027670997,6,1993,Psychological Bulletin,0

This paper develops tests for overidentifying restrictions in Factor-Augmented Vector Autoregressive (FAVAR) models. The identification of structural shocks in FAVAR can involve infinitely many restrictions as the number of cross sections goes to infinity. Our focus is to test the joint null hypothesis that all the restrictions are satisfied. Conventional tests cannot be used due to the large dimension. We transform the infinite-dimensional problem into a finite-dimensional one by combining the individual statistics across the cross section dimension. We find the limit distribution of our joint test statistic under the null hypothesis and prove that it is consistent against the alternative that a fraction of or all identifying restrictions are violated. The Monte Carlo results show that the joint test statistic has good finite-sample size and power. We implement our tests to an updated version of Stock and Watson's (2005) data set. Our test result is further confirmed by the impulse responses of major macroeconomic variables to the monetary policy shock: the impulse responses based on the specification selected by our test are generally more plausible than those based on the specifications rejected by our test.,2-s2.0-84916887065,2,2015,Journal of Econometrics,0

We aim to verify if this measurement artefact exists and, if so, to see if its magnitude can be quantified and generalised across a range of conditions. Using the existing published results from various ad hoc studies to date that have looked at the issue, we quantify the reported decays in service quality and satisfaction scores. In addition, we extend the research into two new crosssectional studies in the catering and financial planning industries. Service quality ratings decay as the time since the service experience increases. The extent of this decay is generalisable to approximately a 10% decline in service scores over a one- to three-month period. The majority of the decay occurs within the first month of the service encounter and then this rate of decline slows down or stabilises. Practical implications: this research adds to the body of knowledge concerning moderators of service quality ratings. It makes an important managerial contribution through providing a generalised decay figure of about 10% that can be used by managers and researchers to separate the confounding effects of temporal decay from real changes in customers' service quality perceptions.",2-s2.0-60349128476,4,2009,International Journal of Market Research,0

The following report challenges the assumption that such beliefs necessarily lead citizens to express neutral feelings toward either the Democrats or the Republicans, or toward both.

When the disadvantaged and insecure are mostly one and the same, the base of popular support for the welfare state is narrow. When the disadvantaged and insecure represent two distinct groups, popular support is broader and opinion less polarized. We test these predictions both across nations within a single policy area (unemployment insurance) and across policy domains within a single polity (the United States, using a new survey). Results are consistent with our predictions and are robust to myriad controls and specifications. When disadvantage and insecurity are more correlated, the welfare state is more contested.",2-s2.0-84861842157,5,2012,American Political Science Review,0

Cultural entrepreneurship and symbolic management perspectives portray entrepreneurs as skilled cultural operators and often assume them to be capable from the outset to purposefully use ‘cultural resources’ in order to motivate resource-holding audiences to support their new ventures. We problematize this premise and develop a model of how entrepreneurs become skilful cultural operators and develop the cultural competences necessary for creating and growing their ventures. The model is grounded in a case study of an entrepreneur who set up shop and sought to acquire resources in a culturally unfamiliar setting. Our model proposes that two adaptive sensemaking processes – approval-driven sensemaking and autonomy-driven sensemaking – jointly facilitate the gradual development of cultural competences. These processes jointly enable entrepreneurs to gain cultural awareness and calibrate their symbolic enactments. Specifically, while approval-driven sensemaking facilitates recognizing cultural resources to symbolically couple a venture’s identity claims more tightly with the cultural frames of targeted audiences and gain legitimate distinctiveness, autonomy-driven sensemaking enables recognizing cultural constraints and more effective symbolic decoupling to shield the venture from constraining cultural frames and defend the venture’s autonomy and resources. We conclude the paper with a discussion of the theoretical implications of our study for cultural entrepreneurship and symbolic management research.",2-s2.0-84930804684,3,2015,Organization Studies,0

There are many debates in the social sciences about the certain and uncertain nature of subjectivity and knowledge. Often these debates create competing theoretical camps, each hell bent on refuting the other (materialist-idealists; modernist-postmodernists; structuralists-post- structuralists; medical-social). These critiques often fail to engage with the social and material lives of human actors, particularly when those actors occupy positions of relative marginalization. This article pitches these debates in emerging accounts of parents of disabled babies, which have developed from a three-year ESRC research study.1 We highlight the ways in which parents adaptively and strategically use and refuse forms of certainty and uncertainty in order to configure ways of living with their children.We suggest that parents are nomadic but also settlers in the journeys with their children, and that modernist and postmodernist analyses both allow us to make sense of parents' situated agency within particular social, cultural and material locations.

Because visual working memory has a very restricted capacity, good filtering mechanisms are essential for its successful functioning. A neuronal signal emitted by the prefrontal cortex is considered to be an important contributor to filtering. Proof of the functional significance of this signal during normal cognitive functioning is, however, still missing. Furthermore, research has so far neglected that the prefrontal cortex must receive input from posterior brain areas that report the necessity to filter. From human electroencephalograms, we extracted several event-related components that reflect the different subprocesses of filtering. On the basis of their timing and a clear pattern of correlations, we reason that filtering might consist of a causal chain of events that involve prefrontal and posterior cortex regions: After distractors are detected in posterior regions, a prefrontal mechanism is activated, which in turn prevents subsequent unnecessary parietal storage of distractor information.",2-s2.0-84893536837,6,2014,Psychological Science,0

The authors investigate how horizontal versus vertical displays of alternatives affect assortment processing, perceived variety, and subsequent choice. Horizontal (vs. vertical) displays are easier to process due to a match between the human binocular vision field (which is horizontal in direction) and the dominant direction of eye movements required for processing horizontal displays. It is demonstrated that this processing fluency allows people to browse information more efficiently, which increases perceived assortment variety and ultimately leads to more variety being chosen, and if the number of options chosen is allowed to vary, it leads to more options chosen. It is shown that because people see more variety in a horizontal (vs. vertical) display, they process a horizontal assortment more extensively. When more variety is positive, they find the choice task easier and have a higher level of satisfaction and confidence about their choices. When more variety is not necessarily positive, for example, in a choice of a single most-preferred option, these effects disappear.

This leniency applies to a select subset of workers and enhances their desired occupational identity.

First, we show that averaging a large number of survey items on the same broadly defined issue area - for example, government involvement in the economy, or moral issues - eliminates a large amount of measurement error and reveals issue preferences that are well structured and stable. This stability increases steadily as the number of survey items increases and can approach that of party identification.

We propose a novel temporal-based theory of how a painful social comparative emotion-job search envy-transmutes as deviant or normative job search behaviors (resume fraud or search effort). We theorize that as job searches progress across time or discrete events, temporal-based pressure increases via perceptions that situations are less changeable or more critical, propelling envious job seekers toward deviant rather than normative search behavior. We propose that market-based pressure, deriving from employment opportunity perceptions, further moderates these effects. In a first study of unemployed job seekers, after more search time passes, job search envy relates to deviant search behavior. Market pressure further qualifies this relationship, although contrary to our prediction, lower market pressure exacerbates rather than attenuates the relationship. Study 2, a two-year study of graduate students engaged in internship and full-time job searches, focuses on event-based temporal pressure and mostly replicates the Study 1 findings. It also indicates that under lower event and market pressures, job seekers expend more effort but do not commit resume fraud in response to job search envy.

People typically find bets less attractive when the probability of receiving a prize is more vague or ambiguous (Ellsberg, 1961).

In this paper we emphasize that ""comparative ignorance"" refers to the state of mind of the decision maker. We extend the comparative ignorance hypothesis by documenting four new ways in which decision context can affect willingness to act under uncertainty that do not rely on the comparative-noncomparative evaluation paradigm used in previous studies. First, people find uncertain bets more attractive when preceded by questions about less familiar items than when preceded by questions about more familiar items. Second, the preference to bet on more familiar domains is less pronounced for the first domain evaluated on a survey than for later domains. Third, people find bets less attractive when they are provided with diagnostic information that they do not know how to use, compared to when they are provided with no such information.

These processes operate outside of awareness. A 4th, conscious process can improve performance in either of 2 ways: by selecting more effective goals of what should be changed in the environment or by selecting and sequencing spatial targets. The theory accounts for patterns of impairment of motor skill learning in patient populations and for learning-related changes in activity in functional imaging studies. It also makes a number of predictions about the purely cognitive, including accounts of mental practice, the representation of motor skill, and the interaction of conscious and unconscious processes in motor skill learning.",2-s2.0-0032116811,6,1998,Psychological Review,0

Early studies on emotion perception, employing static pictures in the chimeric-face paradigm, demonstrated that expressions shown on the left hemi-face (LHF) were rated as more intense, compared to the right hemi-face (RHF). Interestingly, recent studies on emotion production, using high-speed video recordings, discovered an onset asymmetry (OAS) such that spontaneous expressions start earlier in the LHF, while posed expressions start in the RHF. Here, using highly controlled and dynamically developing video stimuli of avatar faces, we tested whether OASs in perceived faces influence the efficiency with which an expression is classified, as well as judgments of expression intensity, spontaneity, and trustworthiness. Videos of avatars making happy and angry expressions, with OASs of either 20 or 400. ms, were judged on several social dimensions by 68 participants. The results highlight the importance of the LHF for emotion classifications and social judgments: Expressions with earlier LHF onsets were not only judged to be more spontaneous but were also detected more quickly and accurately (a difference that was most evident for angry expressions with a briefly presented OAS, but not for happy expressions).

The results are striking. Despite the unanimous typecasting of the volumes as epitomizing either objectivist North American or subjectivist European traditions, the geographic distributions of researchers citing them are indistinguishable. Citations to each compendium are, however, clustered within particular journals and among authors with particular university affiliations-but neither the journals nor universities are neatly North American or European. Current associations of these traditions with North American and European scholarship thus seem driven more by academic rhetoric than authentic continental distinctions. I examine the roots of this rhetorical mapping and explore its implications for the field.

In addition, most studies addressing this topic focus on urban areas, neglecting the equally important issue of juvenile homicide in rural communities. This analysis extends prior research by investigating the structural sources of variation in rural juvenile homicide rates and by examining the influence of religion on this phenomenon. Informing our analyses with theoretical insights drawn from the moral communities and civil society literatures, we investigate the protective effects of civically engaged religious denominations on juvenile family, acquaintance, and stranger homicides in rural counties. For comparative purposes, we also perform parallel analyses on a sample of urban areas. The empirical analyses of county-level data using negative binomial regression estimation techniques indicate that the presence of civically engaged religious adherents is inversely associated with juvenile homicide in rural areas (net of the effects of a range of control variables), but that this protective effect is primarily confined to juvenile family homicides. In contrast, the measure of civically engaged denominations has no effect on juvenile homicide in urban areas.

The question of whether trade affects conflict is important for public policy. To date, theoretical studies have treated trade or the gains from trade as exogenous. However, a dyad's gains from trade are influenced by a number of factors, including foreign aid, tariffs, contiguity, and relative country size. This article presents a mathematical model to extend the conflict - trade model to incorporate foreign aid, tariffs, contiguity, and country size. In particular, we examine how the gains from trade are affected by these factors, with foreign aid, and contiguity increasing the gains from trade and tariffs reducing the gains from trade. Small countries have larger trade gains when trading with a large country than with a small country. If countries seek to protect their trade gains, the model predicts that foreign aid and contiguity will decrease conflict, while tariffs will increase conflict. The contiguity result suggests that conflict between neighboring countries would be greater than observed if not for the mitigating effects of trade. Trade with large countries decreases conflict more than trade with small countries. In addition, rather than concentrating solely on bilateral interactions, the models are specified in enough detail to garner implications concerning the effects of changes in the terms of trade on third parties.

The economy of knowledge involved in such comparisons indicates there are epistemic advantages to using firms and markets, instead of political parties and elections, to allocate scarce resources.

The model predicts that if college costs had ceased to growafter 1961, enrollment in 2010 would have been 3%-6% higher.",2-s2.0-84974777669,2,2016,Journal of Labor Economics,0

The stability of individual differences is a fundamental issue in personality psychology. Although accumulating evidence suggests that many psychological attributes are both stable and change over time, existing research rarely takes advantage of theoretical models that capture both stability and change. In this article, we present the Meta-Analytic Stability and Change model (MASC), a novel meta-analytic model for synthesizing data from longitudinal studies. MASC is based on trait-state models that can separate influences of stable and changing factors from unreliable variance (Kenny & Zautra, 1995). We used MASC to evaluate the extent to which personality traits, life satisfaction, affect, and self-esteem are influenced by these different factors. The results showed that the majority of reliable variance in personality traits is attributable to stable influences (83%). Changing factors had a greater influence on reliable variance in life satisfaction, self-esteem, and affect than in personality (42%-56% vs. 17%). In addition, changing influences on well-being were more stable than changing influences on personality traits, suggesting that different changing factors contribute to personality and well-being. Measures of affect were less reliable than measures of the other 3 constructs, reflecting influences of transient factors, such as mood on affective judgments. After accounting for differences in reliability, stability of affect did not differ from other well-being variables. Consistent with previous research, we found that stability of individual differences increases with age.",2-s2.0-84949255803,6,2016,Journal of Personality and Social Psychology,0

Social violence in Indonesia centres around vigilantism/popular justice and group brawls. This kind of violence occurs frequently and, hence, can be described as 'routine'. While episodic violence associated with intercommunal and secessionist strife gets most attention, the everyday type does not produce headlines, escaping academic scrutiny. As a result, there is no social policy to reduce everyday violence other than police responses. This study seeks to examine the socio-economic determinants of the 'everyday' kind of social violence in Java. The authors employ count-data analysis of panel data for around 100 districts in Java during 1994-2003. Economic crises, which are measured by the size of economic contraction and the increase in poverty, are positively associated with the level of violence. Growth acceleration and poverty reduction are good for social harmony. The study finds a non-linear relationship, in the form of an inverted-U-shaped curve, between violence and the stages of development in terms of income and education. Initially, violence increases as income or education rises, but, later on, the level of violence falls as income or education continues to increase. This is because, at first, the opportunity cost of violence decreases, and then it increases. Therefore, an emphasis on human development in the early phase of development will have a strong violence-reducing impact.",2-s2.0-35148885824,5,2007,Journal of Peace Research,0

However, little attention has been given to whether the type of shared category matters for comparison processes. In this paper, we predicted that the ease with which comparisons are made would vary depending on perceivers' beliefs about the nature of the category to which the comparison targets belong. Specifically, believing that the targets belong to a high-entitativity group was expected to result in faster comparison times than believing that the targets belong to a low-entitativity group. Study results supported this prediction, indicating that perceived group entitativity plays a significant role in intragroup comparison.

As organizations change to become more flexible and transient, the use of a flexible workforce becomes an attractive solution. Temporary employees are here tentatively viewed as being 'betwixt and between' organizational structures, in transit between the relatively fixed positions of full-time, regular employment. Building on previous fieldwork and recent interviews among temporary employees in Sweden and the US, the notion of liminality is employed to explore aspects of temporary work. The liminal position of 'temporaries', it is suggested, is an ambiguous position involving both risks and opportunities for individuals, temporary staffing agencies, and client organizations alike. It may be seen as a seedbed of cultural creativity, where old perspectives on work and subjectivity are contested and new ones created. Related to the transient, mobile character of temporary employment, is an enhanced awareness of substitutability and a continuous reflexive monitoring of manners and competencies. Furthermore, the mobile and temporary character of assignments lead to the development of transient and episodic imagined communities of the workplace. Through the lens of liminality then, temporal and contractual flexibilization of work is seen to challenge the old boundaries of industrial society and to suggest new ways of organizing and experiencing work, as well as new ways of constructing organizational subjectivity.",2-s2.0-0039730061,3,1999,Organization Studies,0

Yet while there is a break from the rationalized, homogeneous modern world, the 'postmodern' world remains ambiguous. Deeply rooted within this struggle for meaning lies language and knowing. Reality is 'made real' through language and thought. One way to remain organized is through the manipulation of thought through language.

The findings suggest that customer satisfaction has a positive, albeit modest, effect on share while consumer economic shopping orientation has a negative direct effect on share. The economic orientation of shoppers, their felt importance of a personal relationship with store personnel, and the level of their aggregate purchase volume moderate the effect of satisfaction on customer share.

Coercive and elitist approaches to political control in post-colonial states like Guyana have often proved counterproductive with respect to resolving ethno-political conflicts in these parts. In Guyana, this contradiction is usually manifested in terms of the escalation of legitimate political competition into overtly violent ethno-political violence and polarization, and reinforced by the consequent devaluation of the more democratic or pacific alternatives to conflict resolution such as mass or grass-roots participation, intergroup negotiations, and third-party mediation. Recurring debates between Cultural Pluralists and Marxists on this issue have so far failed to shed light on the prospects for the more pacific approaches to conflict resolution. Closer analytic scrutiny of actual ethno-political conflict events in Guyana between 1948 and 1999 leads to the understanding that such conflicts derive largely from what is termed a continual crisis of political legitimacy reflected in the inequities of political representation and economic resource distribution across groups.

Yet the search for effective financial education continues. But it is time to ask whether giving every person effective financial education would make us better off. Two reasons it might not are discussed here. First, the time, expense, and invasion of privacy required would be enormous. Second, such a world would entail a decrease in individual autonomy.

The presidential nomination calendar has become increasingly front loaded in recent years as more and more states try to squeeze into the earliest possible dates. This front loading has produced conflict between the national parties and the states and culminated in a nomination calendar with little rhyme or reason to its schedule. Thus, various reform proposals have been suggested. This paper reviews public opinion on two avenues. First, it reports on public evaluations of the current system, which is lukewarm, but public dissatisfaction tends to focus on elements other than the calendar. Second, public support for regional primaries, population-based groupings of primaries and a single-day national primary are examined in polls from 1968 to 2007.",2-s2.0-72149111937,5,2009,Public Opinion Quarterly,0

This article introduces a terror management health model (TMHM). The model integrates disparate health and social psychology literatures to elucidate how the conscious and nonconscious awareness of death can influence the motivational orientation that is most operative in the context of health decisions. Three formal propositions are presented. Proposition 1 suggests that conscious thoughts about death can instigate health-oriented responses aimed at removing death-related thoughts from current focal attention. Proposition 2 suggests that the unconscious resonance of death-related cognition promotes self-oriented defenses directed toward maintaining, not one's health, but a sense of meaning and self-esteem. The last proposition suggests that confrontations with the physical body may undermine symbolic defenses and thus present a previously unrecognized barrier to health promotion activities. In the context of each proposition, moderators are proposed, research is reviewed, and implications for health promotion are discussed.",2-s2.0-56149087820,6,2008,Psychological Review,0

In this study, we examine preferences between lotteries with chances presented either numerically or linguistically. Presentation mode is predicted to affect preferences due to the perception of linguistic chance as skewed distributions of risk. Based upon weighting functions incorporating risk/uncertainty aversion from ambiguity theory and cumulative prospect theory, we predict that presentation mode effects on risky choices will be detectable in very small risks and in large risks. In two experiments, subjects chose between both gain and loss lotteries with constant payoffs and equivalent numeric and linguistic chances. Presentation mode affected choices when chances were above 50%, where lotteries with numeric chances were more frequently preferred in gains while lotteries with linguistic chances were more often preferred in losses. The effect of presentation mode for low-chance lotteries (5% and less) also affected choices such that numeric choices were generally preferred more frequently in losses and linguistically expressed choices were generally preferred more often in gains. Overall, these results suggest that theories of the effects of second order uncertainty on risky choice may be used to model decisions involving linguistic risk. They also suggest that the study of the perception of linguistic risk assessments can provide insight into the cognitive processing behind the weighting functions proposed to depict decision under risk and uncertainty. Finally, the results have practical implications since information providers can affect decision makers' choices by controlling presentation mode in such a way as to alter the relative attractiveness of Uncertain events.",2-s2.0-16144366338,3,1996,Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes,0

Understanding when belligerents are willing to undertake conflict management efforts is an important first step in better understanding how civil conflicts can be dealt with by the international community. In this article, I examine the occurrence of mediation in low-intensity conflicts. Drawing on insights from the war termination literature, I develop a theoretical argument that links mediation in low-intensity conflicts to the evolution of fighting. I argue that, while the characteristics of a conflict and its belligerents influence when mediation happens, how events unfold on the battlefield also influences the occurrence of mediation. I test this argument by looking at low-intensity conflicts in Africa from 1997 to 2004 using data on mediation in low-intensity conflicts and battle-level civil conflict events. The analysis highlights the important effect of battlefield outcomes and locations upon the occurrence of mediation in low-intensity conflicts.",2-s2.0-84922670223,5,2015,Journal of Conflict Resolution,0

Consider a firm that would like to commit to a focused business strategy because focus improves efficiency and thus increases profit. We identify two general conditions under which tougher competition strengthens the firm's ability to commit to a focused strategy. Under these conditions, competition fosters commitment for two reasons: (i) competition reduces the value of the option to diversify (the contestability effect), and (ii) competition increases the importance of being efficient (the efficiency effect). We use a number of different models of imperfect competition to illustrate the applicability of our results. Our examples suggest that the contestability effect is very general. In contrast, the efficiency effect often requires further conditions, which are specific to the nature of competition in each model. In both cases, our analysis helps us predict when these effects are more likely to be observed.",2-s2.0-84994910686,3,2016,Management Science,0

This shift in the party loyalties of the electorate was based on the increased ideological polarization of the Democratic and Republican Parties during the Reagan and post-Reagan eras.

And while self-canceling across respondents tends to translate these individual-level influences into only rather modest effects in the aggregate, on a significant minority of issues, substantial shifts in collective opinion remain.

For the last 50 years, research investigating the effect of emotions on scope of cognitive processing was based on models proposing that affective valence determined cognitive scope. More recently, our motivational intensity model suggests that this past work had confounded valence with motivational intensity. Research derived from this model supports the idea that motivational intensity, rather than affective valence, explains much of the variance emotions have on cognitive scope. However, the motivational intensity model is limited in that the empirical work has examined only positive affects high in approach and negative affects high in avoidance motivation. Thus, perhaps only approach-positive and avoidance-negative states narrow cognitive scope. The present research was designed to clarify these conceptual issues by examining the effect of anger, a negatively valenced approach-motivated state, on cognitive scope. Results revealed that anger narrowed attentional scope relative to a neutral state and that attentional narrowing to anger was similar to the attentional narrowing caused by high approachmotivated positive affects (Study 1). This narrowing of attention was related to trait approach motivation (Studies 2 and Study 3). Anger also narrowed conceptual cognitive categorization (Study 4). Narrowing of categorization related to participants' approach motivation toward anger stimuli. Together, these results suggest that anger, an approach-motivated negative affect, narrows perceptual and conceptual cognitive scope. More broadly, these results support the conceptual model that motivational intensity per se, rather than approach-positive and avoidance-negative states, causes a narrowing of cognitive scope.",2-s2.0-84933179066,6,2015,Journal of Personality and Social Psychology,0

When there is a ""bad apple"" in the group, are we more likely to follow the example or compensate for their sins? Three experiments showed that whether a group member's unethical actions lead to contagion or restitution depends on the presence of out-group observers. In Experiment 1, participants were more likely to compensate for the transgression of an in-group member than an out-group member when there were out-group observers. Experiment 2 varied the presence of out-group observers and showed that such compensatory behaviors occur only in the presence of out-group members. We suggest that the presence of out-group observers trigger a self-categorization process that induces guilt in individuals for their group members' transgressions. Indeed, associated guilt mediated the relationship between in-group member's unethical behavior and participants' compensatory behavior (Experiment 3). These results suggest that norms implied by others' behavior and group categorization are important determinants of ethical behavior.",2-s2.0-70350324940,6,2009,Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,0

First, beginning with three-judge panels, we show the existence of ideological diversity on a panel - and the potential for dissent - plays a significant role in judicial decision making. Second, because of the relationship between panel composition and panel outcomes, considering only the incidence of dissents dramatically underestimates the influence of the institution of dissent - judges dissent much less frequently than they would in the absence of this relationship. Third, this rarity of dissent means they are informative: when judges do dissent, they influence en banc review in a manner consistent with the preferences of full circuits.

In Study 1, participants whose self-views were experimentally manipulated revised their judgments of an immediate ingroup. In Study 2, an analogous manipulation of ingroup traits altered participants' self-views. In Study 3, participants who were ascribed a trait readily projected to and stereotyped from their relevant ingroup, but not to or from an outgroup. Finally, Study 4 provides reaction-latency evidence for social projection and self-stereotyping as judgmental processes leading to self- other correspondence.

In five studies, we found that economic insecurity produced physical pain and reduced pain tolerance. In a sixth study, with data from 33,720 geographically diverse households across the United States, economic insecurity predicted consumption of over-the-counter painkillers. The link between economic insecurity and physical pain emerged when people experienced the insecurity personally (unemployment), when they were in an insecure context (they were informed that their state had a relatively high level of unemployment), and when they contemplated past and future economic insecurity. Using both experimental-causal-chain and measurement-of-mediation approaches, we also established that the psychological experience of lacking control helped generate the causal link from economic insecurity to physical pain. Meta-analyses including all of our studies testing the link from economic insecurity to physical pain revealed that this link is reliable.

Usually, the interviewer handles the dynamics of the question-answer exchange, motivates the respondent and ensures the proper recording of the data. Self-administered modes of data collection, especially web data collection, are more problematic, as the respondents are left alone with a complex and burdensome questionnaire. Therefore, questionnaire layout is crucial for ensuring cooperation and data quality. In this paper we examined three key components of the corresponding web questionnaire: the number of name boxes using a single name generator, question format for assessing alter characteristics (i.e. alter-wise vs. question-wise) and number of name interpreters (i.e. alter characteristics). The number of name boxes was found to be essential for the reported size of social networks and also for some aspects of data quality. Specific data quality effects were also found with respect to variations in question format, where question-wise format performed better than alter-wise. The number of name interpreters had a relatively minor effect.

It is suggested that the recognition of new business opportunities often involves pattern recognitionmdashthe cognitive process through which individuals identify meaningful patterns in complex arrays of events or trends. Basic research on pattern recognition indicates that cognitive frameworks acquired through experience (e.g., prototypes) play a central role in this process. Such frameworks provide individuals with a basis for noticing connections between seemingly independent events or trends (e.g., advances in technology, shifts in markets, changes in government policies, etc.), and for detecting meaningful patterns in these connections. We propose that ideas for new products or services often emerge from the perception of such patterns. New business opportunities are identified when entrepreneurs, using relevant cognitive frameworks, ""connect the dots"" between seemingly unrelated events or trends and then detect patterns in these connections suggestive of new products or services. To obtain evidence on these proposals, we compared the ""business opportunity"" prototypes of novice (first-time) and repeat (experienced) entrepreneursmdashtheir cognitive representations of the essential nature of opportunities. As predicted, the prototypes of experienced entrepreneurs were more clearly defined, richer in content, and more concerned with factors and conditions related to actually starting and running a new venture (e.g., generation of positive cash flow) than the prototypes of novice entrepreneurs.

The approach sees psychological advantages to survivors of continuing to mobilize their own resources; familiarity, trust, and human capital build. The community members themselves decide the steps they are going to take to reestablish ""place,"" thus becoming active participants in reducing the traumatic stress caused by the disaster.

We study the reactions of securities analysts, as important sources of institutional pressures for firms, to the similar product/market strategies undertaken by firms from different prior industries responding to industry convergence. Our empirical setting is the convergence between the wireline telecommunications and cable television industries in the period following the advent of voice over Internet protocol technology. Controlling for firm financial performance and capabilities, we find that analysts were consistently more positive toward the cable firms than toward the wireline telecom firms. Our findings further show that this divergence in reactions arises from differences in existing investor expectations and preferences concerning how firms create value; stocks owned by investors with a greater preference for growth receive more positive reactions than those owned by investors with a greater preference for margins. However, this divergence in reactions shrinks over time as convergence unfolds and as investors shift their shareholdings in response to misalignment between their preferences and firms' strategic changes. Reactions from analysts-reflecting inertial expectations of investors-may persist for a time despite changes to firms' strategies, thus creating challenges for some firms in responding to technological change and industry convergence while legitimating and enabling similar responses from their competitors.",2-s2.0-84877647382,3,2013,Organization Science,0

This means that in a single-list situation, paired-associate learning will appear to progress more slowly under the more variable functional stimulation of low M nominal stimuli. It also means that in a negative-transfer situation, the 2nd task involves recoding when stimuli are low M, but unlearning when stimuli are high M.

In our view, the authors overemphasize the role of communication among organizational members in the constitution of organizations. In contrast, we argue that organizations can also be 'talked into existence' by the communicative acts of third parties (e.g., the media), a view that is consistent with the Montreal School's work. Moreover, drawing on the Stohls' central example of the terrorist organization al Qaeda, we suggest that the attribute 'clandestine' does not capture the essence of that organization because it is characterized by extreme invisibility of its governance structures and by extreme visibility of its terrorist activities.

Life history (LH) theory provides an evolutionary theoretical framework for understanding individualdifferences in maturation, mating, reproduction, parenting, and social interaction. However, the psychometric assessment of human life history has been largely limited to generalized self-reports. Using template matching, this article examines the relationship between personality differences associated with slow-life history (slow-LH) and social behavior in 3 archival datasets. Two of these datasets include direct observations of behavior in the laboratory, and the 3rd provides self-reports of behavior in real life situations experienced within the preceding 24 hr. The results paint a consistent picture of the slow-LH individual as engaging in numerous adaptive social behaviors. However, when ""normativeness"" (the tendency for most people to be normal in both the statistical and evaluative sense) is statistically removed from the LH scores, a slightly different picture emerges. Both slow-LH and fast-LH persons display a number of behaviors that may be either adaptive or maladaptive in different contexts. Specifically, slow-LH individuals tended to behave in a manner that was considerate, kind, hard-working, and reliable but also socially awkward, insecure, and overcontrolling. Fast-LH individuals came across as talkative, socially skilled, dominant, and charming but also unpredictable, hostile, manipulative, and impulsive. These results are consistent with the evolutionary interpretation of LH strategies as being adapted to systematically different environments rather than better or worse approaches to reproductive fitness overall.",2-s2.0-84887550526,6,2013,Journal of Personality and Social Psychology,0

Perceived social problem-solving deficits are associated with suicide risk; however, little research has examined the mechanisms underlying this relationship. The interpersonal theory of suicide proposes 2 mechanisms in the pathogenesis of suicidal desire: intractable feelings of thwarted belongingness (TB) and perceived burdensomeness (PB). This study tested whether TB and PB serve as explanatory links in the relationship between perceived social problem-solving (SPS) deficits and suicidal thoughts and behaviors cross-sectionally and longitudinally. The specificity of TB and PB was evaluated by testing depression as a rival mediator. Self-report measures of perceived SPS deficits, TB, PB, suicidal ideation, and depression were administered in 5 adult samples: 336 and 105 undergraduates from 2 universities, 53 homeless individuals, 222 primary care patients, and 329 military members. Bias-corrected bootstrap mediation and meta-analyses were conducted to examine the magnitude of the direct and indirect effects, and the proposed mediation paths were tested using zero-inflated negative binomial regressions. Cross-sectionally, TB and PB were significant parallel mediators of the relationship between perceived SPS deficits and ideation, beyond depression. Longitudinally and beyond depression, in 1 study, both TB and PB emerged as significant explanatory factors, and in the other, only PB was a significant mediator. Findings supported the specificity of TB and PB: Depression and SPS deficits were not significant mediators.

The present research uses a behavioral observation methodology to examine emotional and behavioral reactions to threatening interpersonal situations in married couples. The research shows that although anxious attachment can hinder people's tendencies to react constructively to threatening events, greater relationship commitment may serve as a buffer against the negative effects associated with attachment insecurities, diminishing feelings of rejection, enhancing feelings of acceptance, and promoting more constructive accommodation behaviors. The research also reveals that wives' degree of relationship commitment has stronger effects on emotional outcomes for both partners than does husbands' degree of commitment. Moreover, husbands' and wives' emotional reactions affect their own accommodative behaviors as well as their spouses' behaviors. These dyadic findings are discussed in terms of attachment theory and interdependence theory.",2-s2.0-72049095050,6,2009,Journal of Personality and Social Psychology,0

The authors show that a prior choice, which activates and boosts a positive self-concept, subsequently licenses the choice of a more self-indulgent option. The authors propose that licensing can operate by committing to a virtuous act in a preceding choice, which reduces negative self-attributions associated with the purchase of relative luxuries. Five studies demonstrate the proposed licensing effect of a prior commitment to a virtuous act on subsequent choice. Consistent with the authors' theory, the preference for an indulgent option diminishes if the licensing task is attributed to an external motivation. The authors also report a mediation analysis in support of their theoretical explanation that the licensing effect operates by providing a temporary boost in the relevant self-concept.",2-s2.0-33744533168,4,2006,Journal of Marketing Research,0

We use a novel dataset from rural Burundi to examine the impact of local exposure to conflict on institutional quality, and try to 'unbundle' institutions by distinguishing between three dimensions of the institutional framework: property rights security, local political institutions, and social capital. We find that conflict exposure affects institutional quality, and document that the impact of conflict on institutional quality may be positive or negative, depending on the institutional measure. Specifically, exposure to violence strengthens in-group social capital and promotes tenure security. However, the appreciation for state institutions is negatively affected by exposure to violence. We find no evidence consistent with design-based theories of institutional quality, or the idea that institutional quality is enhanced by interventions of (non)state external actors. Instead our findings provide some support for the theory of parochial altruism. Our results emphasize the importance for policymakers to consider autonomous responses to conflict when designing development programs.

What role do children play in education and stratification? Are they merely passive recipients of unequal opportunities that schools and parents create for them? Or do they actively shape their own opportunities? Through a longitudinal, ethnographic study of one socioeconomically diverse, public elementary school, I show that children's social-class backgrounds affect when and how they seek help in the classroom. Compared to their working-class peers, middle-class children request more help from teachers and do so using different strategies. Rather than wait for assistance, they call out or approach teachers directly, even interrupting to make requests. In doing so, middle-class children receive more help from teachers, spend less time waiting, and are better able to complete assignments. By demonstrating these skills and strategies, middle-class children create their own advantages and contribute to inequalities in the classroom.

An overwhelming majority of countries signed the comprehensive convention, but several countries - including the industrialized G7 members Italy, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the former West Germany - rejected the new ocean regime in 1982. This article addresses the question of why some states opposed the 1982 convention by examining their preferences for alternative decision-making rules. A policy-seeking approach is used by deriving the preferences of 149 states for different decision-making rules from three components: states' preferences for policies, the working properties of different decision-making rules, and the location of the status quo. Findings show why the 1982 proposal failed to be supported by the main industrialized countries.

Including these polynomials we obtain a reduction in the order of magnitude of the bias, but also inflate the asymptotic variance of the long memory estimator by a multiplicative constant. We show that the estimator is consistent for d∈(0,1), asymptotically normal for d∈(0,34), and if the spectral density is sufficiently smooth near frequency zero, the rate of convergence can become arbitrarily close to the parametric rate, n. A Monte Carlo study reveals that the proposed estimator performs well in the presence of a serially correlated perturbation term.

The structural feature, which we refer to as ecosystem complexity, is a function of the number of unique components or subsystems that interact with the complementor's product.We incorporate the evolutionary features by considering the role of generational transitions initiated by platform firms over time as well as the role of complementors' ecosystem-specific experience. Evidence from Apple's iOS and Google's Android smartphone ecosystems supports our arguments that higher ecosystem complexity helps app developers sustain their superior performance, and that this effect is stronger for more experienced firms. In contrast, platform transitions initiated by Apple and Google make it more difficult for app developers to sustain their performance superiority, and that this effect is exacerbated by the extent of ecosystem complexity.

Men and women were equally constrained by their social origin, even though they faced significantly different opportunity structures in both periods. As the economic transformation took hold, fewer Russians experienced upward mobility and more were downwardly mobile. Political and economic transition, not the demographic replacement of retiring cohorts by younger ones, strengthened the association between origins and destinations.

Here, a general framework is proposed for developing models of lower-level processing. It is argued that our knowledge of ganglion cell function and retinal mechanisms has advanced to the point where a model of lower-level processing should include a testable model of ganglion cell function. This model of ganglion cell function, combined with minimal assumptions about the role of the visual cortex, forms a model of lower-level processing.

We carried out two experiments to investigate how the shading of the options in a response scale affected the answers to the survey questions. The experiments were embedded in two web surveys, and they varied whether the two ends of the scale were represented by shades of the same or different hues. The experiments also varied the numerical labels for the scale points and examined responses to both unipolar scales (assessing frequency) and bipolar scales (assessing favorability). We predicted that the use of different hues would affect how respondents viewed the low end of the scale, making responses to that end seem more extreme than when the two ends were shades of the same hue. This hypothesis was based on the notion that respondents use various interpretive heuristics in assigning meaning to the visual features of survey questions. One such cue is visual similarity. When two options are similar in appearance, respondents will see them as conceptually closer than when they are dissimilar in appearance. The results were generally consistent with this prediction. When the end points of the scale were shaded in different hues, the responses tended to shift toward the high end of the scale, as compared to scales in which both ends of the scale were shaded in the same hue. Though noticeable, this shift was less extreme than the similar shift produced when negative numbers were used to label one end of the scale; moreover, the effect of color was eliminated when each scale point had a verbal label.

A meta-analysis of 150 research reports summarizing the results of multiple behavior domain interventions examined theoretical predictions about the effects of the included number of recommendations on behavioral and clinical change in the domains of smoking, diet, and physical activity. The meta-analysis yielded 3 main conclusions. First, there is a curvilinear relation between the number of behavioral recommendations and improvements in behavioral and clinical measures, with a moderate number of recommendations producing the highest level of change. A moderate number of recommendations is likely to be associated with stronger effects because the intervention ensures the necessary level of motivation to implement the recommended changes, thereby increasing compliance with the goals set by the intervention, without making the intervention excessively demanding. Second, this curve was more pronounced when samples were likely to have low motivation to change, such as when interventions were delivered to nonpatient (vs. patient) populations, were implemented in nonclinic (vs. clinic) settings, used lay community (vs. expert) facilitators, and involved group (vs. individual) delivery formats. Finally, change in behavioral outcomes mediated the effects of number of recommended behaviors on clinical change.

Trade in e-commerce is well known to have benefited individuals, firms and countries in the developed world. However, according to organizations including the WTO, OECD and UNCTAD, as well as the USA and EU, trade in e-commerce is also a means of improving the overall economic growth and performance of less developed nations. In fact, the WTO considers e-commerce to be the key force in integrating LDCs into the multilateral trading system. This paper sets out to problematize this view, not by arguing that e-commerce cannot make an important contribution to development, but by querying the assumptions that underpin current thinking. We start by repairing these defects: the absence of any role for the state; the underestimation of polarization in society and its effect on economic growth; and the failure to distinguish between types of e-commerce. Employing the participation and enhancement classification of e-commerce adoption, we consider whether developing states are ready for the participation phase of e-commerce, if developing countries have the kinds of industries that might act as demand-pull sectors for e-commerce growth, and whether social, political and institutional arrangements are in place to encourage and sustain e-commerce.

We previously proposed that socioeconomic status (SES) is a fundamental cause of health inequalities and, as such, that SES inequalities in health persist over time despite radical changes in the diseases, risks, and interventions that happen to produce them at any given time. Like SES, race in the United States has an enduring connection to health and mortality. Our goals here are to evaluate whether this connection endures because systemic racism is a fundamental cause of health inequalities and, in doing so, to review a wide range of empirical data regarding racial differences in health outcomes, health risks, and health-enhancing resources such as money, knowledge, power, prestige, freedom, and beneficial social connections. We conclude that racial inequalities in health endure primarily because racism is a fundamental cause of racial differences in SES and because SES is a fundamental cause of health inequalities. In addition to these powerful connections, however, there is evidence that racism, largely via inequalities in power, prestige, freedom, neighborhood context, and health care, also has a fundamental association with health independent of SES.

This analysis is framed around rate-distortion theory, a branch of information theory that provides optimal bounds on the accuracy of information transmission subject to a fixed information capacity. The result of the ideal observer analysis is a theoretical framework that provides a task-independent and quantitative definition of visual memory capacity and yields novel predictions regarding human performance. These predictions are subsequently evaluated and confirmed in 2 empirical studies. Further, the framework is general enough to allow the specification and testing of alternative models of visual memory (e.g., how capacity is distributed across multiple items). We demonstrate that a simple model developed on the basis of the ideal observer analysis-one that allows variability in the number of stored memory representations but does not assume the presence of a fixed item limit-provides an excellent account of the empirical data and further offers a principled reinterpretation of existing models of VWM.",2-s2.0-84861874499,6,2012,Psychological Review,0
2220,62350,"Mondak J.J., Sanders M.S.",The complexity of tolerance and intolerance judgments: A response to Gibson,"The complexity of tolerance and intolerance judgments: A response to Gibson. In a recent paper, we posited that tolerance and intolerance judgments are characterized by two forms of variance. First, the distinction between tolerance and intolerance is dichotomous in that individuals are or are not willing to extend the full rights of citizenship to all others without exception. Second, among those not so willing, variance exists in the breadth and depth of their intolerance. James Gibson challenges our view, arguing that we have advanced a fundamental shift in how tolerance is conceptualized, and that this shift is not warranted empirically because very few Americans are tolerant under our definition. In this response, we first outline the rationale for why our view does not constitute a significant shift in the conceptualization of tolerance, but rather is merely an effort to pull the empirical treatment of tolerance into alignment with the concept's common definition. Second, we explain that Gibson's finding that few Americans are tolerant gains noteworthy meaning and significance from the view of tolerance we present. Lastly, we demonstrate that new insight on the antecedents of tolerance and intolerance emerges when analyses attend to the two-part structure of tolerance judgments highlighted in our research.",2-s2.0-27844570286,5,2005,Political Behavior,0

East Germany's unanticipated revolution in 1989 poses an interesting challenge to social movement research. The relatively spontaneous, peaceful revolution that toppled the communist regime cannot be fully explained by the prevailing theories of revolution and collective action. While both structurally oriented and identity-oriented theory offers insight into the revolutionary process, neither are completely satisfactory. Most theories assume a relatively open field of political contestation and conditions of relative social freedom that were absent in East Germany. I suggest a synthetic, historically specific approach in which collective identities are situated with small-scale social networks. The crucial factors in making the revolution possible were shared grievances and the expectation of social solidarity. Though they were politically subordinated, ordinary East Germans expressed grievances and nurtured opposition in small circles of confidants. Reference to collective identities helped to mobilize and frame opposition in East Germany making a swift, unexpected revolution possible once the state began to founder.",2-s2.0-0030502664,7,1996,Social Forces,0

Under the sociological theory of homophily, people who are similar to one another are more likely to interact with one another. Marketers often have access to data on interactions among customers from which, with homophily as a guiding principle, inferences could be made about the underlying similarities. However, larger networks face a quadratic explosion in the number of potential interactions that need to be modeled. This scalability problem renders probability models of social interactions computationally infeasible for all but the smallest networks. In this paper, we develop a probabilistic framework for modeling customer interactions that is both grounded in the theory of homophily and is flexible enough to account for random variation in who interacts with whom. In particular, we present a novel Bayesian nonparametric approach, using Dirichlet processes, to moderate the scalability problems that marketing researchers encounter when working with networked data. We find that this framework is a powerful way to draw insights into latent similarities of customers, and we discuss how marketers can apply these insights to segmentation and targeting activities.",2-s2.0-79957629269,4,2011,Marketing Science,0

In addition, productivity growth is more correlated across industries within one country than across countries within one industry. Using an error-components model, it finds that a substantial fraction of changes in annual productivity can be attributed to nation-specific factors that are common across industries. The evidence suggests that short-run productivity growth is similar across industries in a nation but less similar across countries in any specific industry. -Author",2-s2.0-0027728812,2,1993,Journal of Political Economy,0

To explain this reversal, five competing hypotheses are tested using both regression and fuzzy-set methods.

Understanding thoughts with no perceptual basis is a complex problem, and the commentary by Franklin, Mrazek, Broadway, and Schooler (2013) highlighted some of the difficulties that can occur when theorizing about this topic. They argued that the suppression of external input during internal thought arises from the selection of internal information. However, once a process of competition has been resolved in favor of self-generated content, it is still necessary to explain the stability of that content over time. It is proposed that perceptual decoupling and the associated attenuation of external input make environmental information less likely to gain access to limited resources explaining how internal thoughts persist over time. Franklin and colleagues also claimed that perceptual decoupling is unnecessary for an internal train of thought because statements of necessity cannot be drawn from correlational evidence. However, experimentally induced internal trains of thought also compete with concurrent external information, and this mutual inhibition is easily explained by assuming perceptual decoupling is necessary for the integrity of a detailed internal train of thought. I argue that the fundamental advantage of the process- occurrence framework is to highlight that self-generated thought is an emergent property from a general-purpose cognitive architecture and that models such as these will deepen our understanding more effectively than those focused on describing specific mental states.",2-s2.0-84877140146,6,2013,Psychological Bulletin,0

In other product categories, high-priced brands are consistently of high quality, but quality of lowpriced brands varies widely. Three experiments demonstrate that such heteroscedasticity leads to more extreme price-based quality predictions. This finding suggests that quality inferences do not only stem from what consumers have learned about the average level of quality at different price points through exemplarmemory or rule abstraction. Instead, quality predictions are also based on learning about the covariation between price and quality.

We experimentally assess the accuracy of people's predictions of others' risky choices. In four studies, we find evidence of systematic inaccuracy: predictions of others' choices are too regressive. That is, people predict that others' choices will be closer to risk neutrality than those choices actually are. Where people are risk seeking, they predict that others will be risk seeking but substantially less so; likewise, where people are risk averse, they predict that others will be risk averse but substantially less so. Put differently, people predict that others' choices will reveal a more muted form of prospect theory's fourfold pattern of risk preferences than actually prevails.

In particular, a firm with an undesirable (low-quality) product is able to attract consumers who would have not incurred a search cost had they known its true quality. In this case, a semiseparating equilibrium occurs where the lowest firm types pool upward in order to increase the expected product quality while simultaneously signaling that the product is affordable.

Throughout the campaign, innumerable images of Obama and his family contradicted negative racial stereotypes and changed the balance of black exemplars in mass media in a positive direction, thus causing reductions in prejudice among political television viewers. Exposure to Obama caused the largest reductions in prejudice among McCain supporters, Republicans, and conservatives. Although these individuals surely resisted Obama's political message, consistent with previous research, racial exemplars influence judgments without deliberative processing, thus minimizing resistance to counter-stereotypical portrayals. Because conservatives have more negative preexisting images of blacks, exposure to Obama countered their expectations far more than those with more positive expectations. Moreover, consistent with the psychological basis for mediated intergroup contact, even exposure to conservative programs that criticized Obama's politics reduced prejudice because these programs nonetheless portrayed him as countering negative racial stereotypes.

We study the politics of intergenerational redistribution in an overlapping generations model with short-lived governments. The successive governments - who care about the welfare of the currently living generations and possibly about campaign contributions - are unable to precommit the future course of redistributive taxation. In a stationary politico-economic equilibrium, the intergenerational transfer in each period depends on the current value of the state variable and all expectations about future political outcomes are fulfilled. We find that there exist multiple stationary equilibria in many political settings. Steady-state welfare is often lower than it would be in the absence of redistibutive politics.",2-s2.0-0031774026,2,1998,Economic Journal,0

Names often indicate belonging to a certain ethnic group. When immigrant parents choose a first name for their child that is common in their host society, they show a high degree of acculturation. In contrast, selecting a name common only in the parents' country of origin indicates ethnic maintenance. Using data from the German Socio-economic Panel for Turkish, Southwest European, and former Yugoslav immigrants, the authors show that acculturation in terms of name giving depends on several factors: the cultural boundary between the country of origin and the host society, the parents' sociostructural integration in terms of education and citizenship, interethnic networks, and religious affiliation.",2-s2.0-65949096314,7,2009,American Journal of Sociology,0

Has self-enhancement been too heavily emphasized as a motivating factor in social comparisons? Recently, researchers have argued that some types of social-comparative judgments may differ in important ways from other self-evaluative phenomena typically offered as evidence of self-enhancement motivation. In contrast to a large body of research showing that self-esteem threat affects other self-evaluative processes, the literature remains silent on how self-esteem threat affects social comparisons between self and an average peer. Furthermore, whereas social comparisons appear to be self-favoring (i.e. 'better than average') in many domains, they are predictably self-deprecating (i.e., 'worse than average') in others. As a result, recent models of social-comparative judgment posit that cognitive efficiency, rather than self-enhancement, may more typically account for the manner in which people compare themselves to peers. The current research addresses this controversy by investigating how the tension between self-enhancement and need for cognitive efficiency is resolved in social comparison. Two experiments examined the crossed effects of self-esteem threat and cognitive load on social comparisons of personality traits (Experiment 1) and likelihood of future events (Experiment 2a-b). Both self-esteem threat and cognitive load increased the self-favoring nature of social comparisons including those otherwise characterized by self-deprecation. The findings show that self-enhancement does significantly influence social comparison with peers and, in fact, most parsimoniously accounts for these social-comparative judgments when cognitive resources are limited. Furthermore, self-deprecating social comparisons are attenuated in the face of self-esteem threat and, therefore, do not provide a substantial challenge to the role of self-enhancement in social comparison.",2-s2.0-84877012926,6,2013,Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,0

Something of Sacks' analytic mentality and style are illustrated through the analysis of two data extracts: an emergency 999 call and a face-to-face sales encounter. A distinctive way of doing organizational analysis is discussed that foregrounds knowledgeability and agency via the examination of sequence and method. Sacks raises the possibility that organization might be recoverable from the fine-grained detail of actual episodes. The idea that order, intelligibility and the constitution of social scenes might have a basis aside from the more general notion of discourse is discussed.

Current scholarship commonly posits that network recruitment contributes to job sex segregation and that the segregated nature of personal contact networks explains this effect. A variety of empirical findings inconsistent with this explanation demonstrate its inadequacy. Building on Kanter's observation that recruitment processes often resemble ""homosocial reproduction"" [Kanter RM (1977) Men and Women of the Corporation (Basic Books, New York)], we develop a population dynamics model of network recruitment. The resulting formal model builds a parsimonious theory regarding the segregating effects of network recruitment, resolving the puzzles and inconsistencies revealed by recent empirical findings. This revised theory also challenges conventional understandings of how network recruitment segregates: in isolation, network recruitment-even with segregated networks-is more likely to desegregate rather than segregate. Network recruitment segregates primarily through its interactions with other supply-side (e.g., gendered self-sorting) or demand-side (e.g., gendered referring rates) biasing mechanisms. Our model reveals whether and to what extent network recruitment segregates or desegregates, and it reveals opportunities for organizational intervention. There is an easily calculable tipping point where demand-side factors such as gender differences in referring can counteract and neutralize other segregating effects from referring. Independent of other personnel practices, organizational policies affecting employees' referring behaviors can tip the balance to determine whether network recruitment serves as a segregating or desegregating force. We ground our model empirically using three organizational cases.",2-s2.0-84951076207,3,2015,Organization Science,0

Deductions from the model include a positive equilibrium value for the amount of war and the level of resources devoted to war fighting and preparations, the finding that additional transmission mechanisms increase the equilibrium level as well as the speed at which the equilibrium level is approached, and the conclusion that extraordinarily high levels of war will eventually decrease.

Since 11 September 2001, the religious dimension of conflict has been the focus of increasing attention. In The Clash of Civilizations, Huntington has identified the West in religious-cultural terms, as Christian with a dominant democratic culture emphasizing tolerance, moderation and consensus. The persistence of conflict in Northern Ireland among 'White' Protestant and Catholic Christians undermines this simplistic argument and demands a more subtle understanding of the role of religion and fundamentalism in contemporary conflict. Modernization theory - which is echoed among some theorists of globalization - had predicted the declining importance of religion as the world became industrialized and increasingly interconnected. This is echoed by those who argue that the Northern Ireland conflict is 'ethno-national' and dismiss the role of religion. On the other hand, others have claimed that the conflict is religious and stress the role of Protestant fundamentalism. This article draws on new evidence from Northern Ireland of the complex and subtle ways in which religion impacts on the conflict there, incorporating insights about the pragmatism of fundamentalist Protestants and how religious actors are contributing to conflict transformation. This analysis leads to three broader conclusions about understanding conflicts with religious dimensions. First, the complexity of religion must be understood, and this includes a willingness to recognize the adaptability of fundamentalisms to particular contexts. Second, engaging with fundamentalists and taking their grievances seriously opens up possibilities for conflict transformation. Third, governments and religious actors within civil society can play complementary roles in constructing alternative (religious) ideologies and structures as part of a process of transformation. In a world in which the impact of religion is persistent, engaging with the religious dimension is a vital part of a broader-based strategy for dealing with conflict.",2-s2.0-42149163413,5,2008,Journal of Peace Research,0

When these events are instead fictional or removed in time, they should be perceived as more psychologically distant and evoke weaker affective reactions. The current research shows that, while consumers’ intuitions are in line with this prediction, their actual emotional experiences are surprisingly insensitive to the distancing information. For instance, readers of a sad story overestimated how much their emotional reaction would be reduced by knowing that it described a fictional event. Similarly, game participants overestimated how much their excitement about winning a prize would be dampened by knowing that the prize would only be available later. We propose that actual readers and prize winners were too absorbed by the hedonic experience to incorporate the distancing information, resulting in surprisingly strong affective reactions to fictional stories and delayed prizes.",2-s2.0-84906978882,4,2014,Journal of Consumer Research,0

Three studies are presented which examine how reference points based on personal preferences and budget constraints (i.e., reservation values) are combined with reference points based on available market information to affect outcomes. These studies support the interpretation that in captive transactions, contextual cues determine the extent to which market information versus reservation values influence outcomes. Certain contextual cues trigger perceptions of low versus high price variance, which in turn, lead negotiators to weight market information more or less heavily in internal processing and bargaining. When perceptions of low price variance are present, market information influences outcomes more than private reservation values. When perceptions of high price variance are present, reservation values tend to be more dominant in determining outcomes.",2-s2.0-0030268994,3,1996,Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes,0

However, this presents a sociological problem, for the dominant sociological purchase on land is one which routinely interprets it as a social construction. The paper presented here differs, as it focuses on particular cultural symbols which have a socio-historical resonance in relation to land, and makes the argument that they maintain this presence because of their (inter)connection with particular social groupings, notably landowners. Therefore, it is simply not enough to identify landowners' status in law as the root cause of their power, but instead it should be seen as only one facet of it. I conclude by suggesting that just as important is the way in which landowners have appropriated cultural interpretations of the land to forefront their powers.",2-s2.0-0034355211,7,2000,Sociology,0

The simulation results show that a reduction in military expenditure to one-half of its 1992 level by the year 2000, with the released peace dividend' allocated to other government current and capital expenditures, would lead to a reduction in unemployment of 0.52 million and an increase in output above base by 1.84%. While these results do hide potential problems at industry, company, region and local community levels, it is argued that these problems of transition are both smaller and less difficult to deal with than those experienced in the past. The restructuring of the arms industry is already taking place and the required local adjustments are no worse than those experienced by traditional manufacturing industry over the past decade and, with careful planning, could be made painless. Overall, it is clear that with sensible adjustment policies the reduction of military spending provides an opportunity for improved economic performance.",2-s2.0-84965667772,5,1991,Journal of Peace Research,0

Experimental and protocol-based research has demonstrated convincingly that consumers frequently use simplification heuristics prior to making choices. Consequently, quantitative choice models incorporating simplification strategies recently have received much research attention. Given the additional computational cost and complexity involved in estimating these models, the authors investigate how robustly the standard logit model accommodates choice simplification processes. The results show that when consumers screen brands using an elimination-by-aspects strategy, logit forecasts choices reasonably well, but the parameter estimates are severely biased. However, when consumers screen through brands previously purchased, augmented by brands promoted, logit both forecasts poorly and produces biased parameter estimates, even when dedicated screening variables are included in the logit utility function. The predictive validity of logit improves somewhat when the universal set size is small and when purchase event feedback is less important.",2-s2.0-0032368626,4,1998,Journal of Marketing Research,0
2289,75693,"Dunn J.R., Schweitzer M.E.",Feeling and believing: The influence of emotion on trust,"Feeling and believing: The influence of emotion on trust. The authors report results from 5 experiments that describe the influence of emotional states on trust. They found that incidental emotions significantly influence trust in unrelated settings. Happiness and gratitude - emotions with positive valence - increase trust, and anger - an emotion with negative valence - decreases trust. Specifically, they found that emotions characterized by other-person control (anger and gratitude) and weak control appraisals (happiness) influence trust significantly more than emotions characterized by personal control (pride and guilt) or situational control (sadness). These findings suggest that emotions are more likely to be misattributed when the appraisals of the emotion are consistent with the judgment task than when the appraisals of the emotion are inconsistent with the judgment task. Emotions do not influence trust when individuals are aware of the source of their emotions or when individuals are very familiar with the trustee.

Although the semantic relationships among words have long been acknowledged as a crucial component of adult lexical knowledge, the ontogeny of lexical networks remains largely unstudied. To determine whether learners encode relationships among novel words, we trained 2-year-olds on four novel words that referred to four novel objects, which were grouped into two visually similar pairs. Participants then listened to repetitions of word pairs (in the absence of visual referents) that referred to objects that were either similar or dissimilar to each other. Toddlers listened significantly longer to word pairs referring to similar objects, which suggests that their representations of the novel words included knowledge about the similarity of the referents. A second experiment confirmed that toddlers can learn all four distinct words from the training regime, which suggests that the results from Experiment 1 reflected the successful encoding of referents. Together, these results show that toddlers encode the similarities among referents from their earliest exposures to new words.",2-s2.0-84885344872,6,2013,Psychological Science,0

Drawing on three years of participant observation in a Liberian immigrant community, this article examines the role of legal refugee status in immigrants' daily encounters with the state. Using the literature on immigrant incorporation, claims making, and citizenship, it argues that refugee status profoundly shapes individuals' views and expectations of their host government as well as their interactions with the medical, educational, and social service institutions they encounter. The refugees in this study use their refugee status to make claims for legal and social citizenship and to distance themselves from native-born blacks. In doing so, they validate their own position vis-à-vis the state and in the American ethno-racial hierarchy. The findings presented demonstrate how refugee status operates as a symbolic and interpretive resource used to negotiate the structural realities of the welfare state and American race relations. These results stress the importance of studying immigrant incorporation from a micro perspective and suggest mechanisms for the adaptational advantages for refugees reported in existing research. copy; 2011 by Society for the Study of Social Problems, Inc.

Pairs of trustors play finitely repeated Trust Games with the same trustee in a laboratory experiment. We study trustfulness of the trustor and trustworthiness of the trustee. We distinguish between learning and control effects on behavior. Learning effects are related to the trustor's information on past behavior of the trustee. Control effects are related to the trustor's opportunities for sanctioning a trustee in future interactions. Hypotheses on learning and control effects are derived from backward-looking learning models and from forward-looking models of strategic behavior. The design of the experiment, with respect to trustfulness, allows for disentangling learning effects from a trustor's own experience with the trustee and learning effects through third-party information. Also, the design enables disentangling control effects on trustworthiness and trustfulness through a trustor's own sanction opportunities and opportunities for third-party sanctions. We find evidence for learning and control effects. The trustor's own experiences, the experiences of the other trustor, as well as the trustor's own sanction opportunities affect trustfulness. We find evidence for control effects on trustworthiness, including effects arising from opportunities for third-party sanctions. However, there is no evidence for control effects through opportunities for third-party sanctions on trustfulness.

Guided by attachment theory, a 2-part study was conducted to test how perceptions of relationship-based conflict and support are associated with relationship satisfaction/closeness and future quality. Dating partners completed diaries for 14 days (Part 1) and then were videotaped while discussing a major problem that occurred during the diary study (Part 2). Part 1 reveals that more anxiously attached individuals perceived more conflict with their dating partners and reported a tendency for conflicts to escalate in severity. Perceptions of daily relationship-based conflicts negatively impacted the perceived satisfaction/closeness and relationship futures of highly anxious individuals, whereas perceptions of greater daily support had positive effects. Pan 2 reveals that highly anxious individuals appeared more distressed and escalated the severity of conflicts (rated by observers) and reported feeling more distressed.

In multidimensional unfolding multidimensional scaling (MDS) procedures, the predicted utility of a brand for a consumer is inversely related to the distance between that consumer's ideal point and the brand position in the derived space. Most MDS models treat all brands the same regardless of their respective market share. In many product categories, however, consumer preferences are heavily influenced by the size of the existing market share (i.e., the brand mass). This article presents two versions of a new spatial methodology that incorporates the effects of brand as well as consumer mass via a spatial gravity model of consumer utility; that is, the attraction of a brand for a consumer depends not only on the distance of the brand from a consumer's ideal point but also on the current market size of the brand, as well as the consumer purchase pattern and volume. One version of the proposed model estimates brand positions and individual ideal points with two-way or three-way pick any/N binary choice data. The second version we develop provides the same spatial decomposition for two-way or three-way metric preference/dominance data. We also develop a series of nested MDS models to estimate, test, and compare four different model structures with respect to any common data set.

Field studies linking workforce age to performance treat performance as one-dimensional and often focus on individual not organizational performance. To analyze the effects of workforce age on organizational performance, we suggest treating performance as multi-dimensional with at least two output dimensions: quantity and quality. We provide a novel conceptual framework that borrows insights from multiple disciplines to better understand ageing phenomena in organizations. In particular, we build on psychological and medical studies showing that individual age has different effects on different cognitive capabilities. As a result, we argue that workforce ageing may affect various performance dimensions, such as quantity and quality, in different, often opposite ways. In our empirical part we examine a unique dataset containing detailed court data over a time span of 19 years. We find that average workforce age is linked negatively to quantitative organizational performance but positively to qualitative organizational performance. Our findings suggest that future organizational studies should decompose performance at least along the quantity-quality dimension. Our theoretical framework helps to understand the different types of ageing effects and to derive itemized implications for changes in organizational performance. It also helps to reconcile contradictory findings of previous studies and to derive important managerial implications for task assignments, career policies and company strategies in view of upcoming demographic changes in many developed countries.",2-s2.0-80052243582,3,2011,Organization Studies,0

Integrative complexity broadly measures the structural complexity of statements. This breadth, although beneficial in multiple ways, can potentially hamper the development of specific theories. In response, the authors developed a model of complex thinking, focusing on 2 different ways that people can be complex within the integrative complexity system and subsequently developed measurements of each of these 2 routes: Dialectical complexity focuses on a dialectical tension between 2 or more competing perspectives, whereas elaborative complexity focuses on complexly elaborating on 1 singular perspective. The authors posit that many variables have different effects on these 2 forms of complexity and subsequently test this idea in 2 different theoretical domains. In Studies 1a, 1b, and 2, the authors demonstrate that variables related to attitude strength (e.g., domain importance, extremism, domain accessibility) decrease dialectical complexity but increase elaborative complexity. In Study 3, the authors show that counterattitudinal lying decreases dialectical complexity but increases elaborative complexity, implicating a strategic (as opposed to a cognitive strain) view of the lying-complexity relationship. The authors argue that this dual demonstration across 2 different theoretical domains helps establish the utility of the new model and measurements as well as offer the potential to reconcile apparent conflicts in the area of cognitive complexity.",2-s2.0-56349127280,6,2008,Journal of Personality and Social Psychology,0

We also examine whether misalignment between transaction and supplier characteristics and the control structure is associated with ex post performance problems.

Factor analysis of the use of 24 contract terms reveals four groups of contract terms that are commonly used in combination. We interpret these factors as ""dimensions of management control"" and label them: assignment of rights, product and price, after-sales service, and legal recourse. Characteristics associated with hazards are positively related to the use of all four dimensions of management control, with different hazards associated with different controls. We then examine the relation between transaction characteristics and ex post transaction problems, demonstrating that even in the presence of mutually agreeable contracts, hazards remain. We conclude that costs of contracting are associated with increased use of contract terms on assignment of rights, after-sales service, and legal recourse.

In recent years, a number of large restaurant franchisors have securitized their brands to raise funds, including Dunkin Brands and Domino's Pizza (Domino's). We use property rights approach to show that IP securitization provides mechanisms that explicitly define ownership of intangible assets within the securitization structure and thus enables a company to raise funds against these assets.

The latter are different from those interventions that only see one mediator, however: mediators forming a coalition are likely to be constrained by different domestic factors and may have different incentives than states pursuing unilateral approaches. Thus, ignoring these patterns can have serious consequences for our theoretical expectations and empirical inferences on mediation onset. In order to address this shortcoming, this article introduces concepts from the coalition-formation literature to the existent research on mediation, and examines the onset of multiparty mediation from a twofold perspective. First, there are supply-side determinants, that is, interveners' incentives for multiparty mediation. Second, the author studies demand-side influences, that is, factors pertaining to the belligerents. By analyzing data for 1950-2000, the following research's main contribution stems from the empirical test of the theoretical framework in a quantitative research design. The results point to a disconnect between the factors that promote single-party mediation onset and those that promote multiparty mediations.",2-s2.0-84866950834,5,2012,Journal of Peace Research,0

Although heterogeneity in consumption communities is pervasive, there is little understanding of its impact on communities. This study shows how heterogeneous communities operate and interact with the marketplace. Specifically, the authors draw on actor-network theory, conceptualizing community as a network of heterogeneous actors (i.e., individuals, institutions, and resources), and examine the interplay of these actors in a mainstream activity-based consumption community -the distance running community. Findings, derived from a multimethod investigation, show that communities can preserve continuity even when heterogeneity operates as a destabilizing force. Continuity preserves when community members depend on each other for social and economic resources: a dependency that promotes the use of frame alignment practices. These practices enable the community to (re)stabilize, reproduce, and reform over time. The authors also highlight the overlapping roles of consumers and producers and develop a dimensional characterization of communities that helps bridge prior research on brand communities, consumption subcultures, and consumer tribes.",2-s2.0-84873874950,4,2013,Journal of Consumer Research,0

This study tests contradictory hypotheses regarding the implications of service sector growth in post-industrial societies on gender stratification. Panel analyses of 1970 and 1980 U.S. census data from the largest 124 MSAs reveal that increasing employment in service industries reduces the gender gap in median earnings net of changes in human capital and community variables. Findings also support the ""deindustrialization thesis"" in that service sector growth is economically detrimental to both sexes. However, men's earnings deteriorate at a faster rate than women's earnings resulting in greater similarity between male and female earnings. The results imply that men in metropolitan labor markets experiencing greater employment in service industries suffer lower earnings because of dwindling high-wage blue-collar jobs. A larger male service sector component also reduces occupational sex segregation, thus helping to equalize the earnings of men and women.",2-s2.0-0026290591,7,1991,Social Forces,0

Six groups of actors emerge. Using game theory, the interactions among these actors are formally analyzed. The possibility of political pact in the first phase of change is identified with the possibility of cooperation between players in games in which the equilibrium is a deficient outcome. Three models of transition by agreement are established: agreed reform within the ruling bloc, controlled opening to the opposition, and sudden collapse of the authoritarian regime. Each of these models entails differences in the pace of change and in the limits of the pact and can be associated with different cases of transition in Southern Europe, Latin America, and Eastern Europe.",2-s2.0-84928441262,5,1991,American Political Science Review,0

This article investigates the effect of time pressure on choice deferral. Recent research suggests that the likelihood of deferral is contingent on the ease of making the selection decision (which option to choose) as well as the overall attractiveness of the selected alternative. We focus on how time pressure systematically impacts choice deferral by increasing the use of noncompensatory decision rules in the selection decision and by increasing the relative emphasis placed on the unique features in the deferral decision (whether to choose). Consistent with the hypotheses, we find over a series of five studies that time pressure (1) decreases choice deferral when choice involves high conflict but not when conflict is low, (2) reduces the impact of shared features on choice deferral, and (3) decreases choice deferral for sets with common bad and unique good features (approach-approach conflict) but not for sets with common good and unique bad features (avoidance-avoidance conflict). We further show that greater attention to the unique features is not a general property of decision making under time pressure but rather a consequence of the primacy of the selection decision over the deferral decision. Consistent with this premise, time pressure did not decrease the relative attention paid to common features when the task was described as purely a deferral decision. The theoretical and practical implications of the findings are discussed.",2-s2.0-0033245089,4,1999,Journal of Consumer Research,0

Based on data from our Citizen Political Ambition Study, the first large-scale national survey of potential candidates, we examine the process by which women and men emerge as candidates for public office. We find that women who share the same personal characteristics and professional credentials as men express significantly lower levels of political ambition to hold elective office. Two factors explain this gender gap: first, women are far less likely than men to be encouraged to run for office; second, women are significantly less likely than men to view themselves as qualified to run.

While the literature on the political use of military force by the USA has undergone tremendous growth in recent years, one crucial feature of this foreign policy activity has not been modeled - the conditions that give rise to the crises that precipitate a use of force. It is possible that many of the findings on the diversionary use of force obtain because of problems with selection effects. More uses of force may occur during certain periods simply because more crises occur during these times. Therefore, I explain how we may model crisis occurrence and the use of force to help us better understand the role of selection effects and the salience of domestic conditions in the decision to use force. I outline several hypotheses regarding the influence of domestic and crisis-specific factors to predict when opportunities to use force will occur and, given some opportunity, when a president will use military force. The results demonstrate that by not accounting for selection effects in the decision to use force by US presidents, we may have erroneously concluded that presidents use force to divert public attention.",2-s2.0-0034398143,5,2000,Journal of Peace Research,0

In decision research, it is widely assumed that decision makers have subjective experiences which indicate definitively, albeit with random fluctuations, whether or not one alternative is preferable to another. Further, it is assumed that subjects' choices reflect this underlying preference order. It follows from this position, as a logical consequence rather than an empirical observation, that if a manipulation affects people's choices, it does so by changing the way people subjectively experience the alternatives (presumably via people's encoding or combination of attribute information). In psychophysics, an analogous theoretical position has been relinquished. Specifically, it is no longer believed that observers in a detection experiment have subjective experiences which indicate definitively, albeit with error, whether a signal has been perceived. Rather, according to signal detection theory, the observer's sensory experience can be portrayed as a quantifiable sensation that must be converted into an overt report of ""signal present"" or ""signal absent"" by comparing the sensation with a criterion. In this paper, we describe two models of preferential choice, the lexicographic criterion model and a probabilistic criterion model, that replace the notion of definitive preference with an analogue of signal detection theory. In the models, the decision maker is represented as having quantifiable inclinations, rather than definitive preferences, that must be converted into an overt choice by comparing the inclinations with a criterion. By attributing the effects of experimental manipulations to shifts in the criterion, rather than to changes in people's inclinations, the model offers a testable alternative to the proposition that altered choices imply altered preferences.",2-s2.0-38249010471,3,1992,Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes,0

Eight studies confirm that this is indeed the case, with the result holding even for stick figures, thus controlling for typical visual indicators of social class such as clothing or jewelry. Furthermore, these social class inferences mediate a relationship between social density and product valuation, with individuals assessing both higher prices and a greater willingness to pay for products presented in less crowded contexts. This effect of inferred class on product valuation is explained by status-motivated individuals’ desire to associate with higher-status people. To the best of our knowledge, this research is the first to reveal the link between social density, status inferences, and object valuations. As such, it makes a novel contribution to what has come to be known in sociology as the topological turn: a renewed focus on social space.",2-s2.0-84938086858,4,2015,Journal of Consumer Research,0

In particular, the authors suggest that human beings possess cognitive adaptations designed to cause them to avoid poor social exchange partners, join cooperative groups (for purposes of between-group competition and exploitation), and avoid contact with those who are differentially likely to carry communicable pathogens.

We propose that gender-biased attributions about the charismatic leadership of men and women are facilitated by the operation of a leader-in-social-network schema. Attributions of charismatic leadership depend on the match between the gender of the leader and the perceived structure of the network. In three studies encompassing both experimental and survey data, we show that when team advice networks are perceived to be centralized around one or a few individuals, women leaders are seen as less charismatic than men leaders. However, when networks are perceived to be cohesive (many connections among individuals), it is men who suffer a charismatic leadership disadvantage relative to women.

We argue that local information transmission generates changes in participation that are geographically heterogeneous, locally correlated, and smooth in the aggregate, just like those observed in our data. In our model, women learn about the effects of maternal employment on children by observing nearby employed women. When few women participate in the labor force, data are scarce and participation rises slowly. As information accumulates in some regions, the effects of maternal employment become less uncertain and more women in that region participate. Learning accelerates, labor force participation rises faster, and regional participation rates diverge. Eventually, information diffuses throughout the economy, beliefs converge to the truth, participation flattens out, and regions become more similar again. To investigate the empirical relevance of our theory, we use a new county-level data set to compare our calibrated model to the time series and geographic patterns of participation.",2-s2.0-79959912936,2,2011,Econometrica,0

Synthesizes data pertaining to the variability of human force production as a function of the amount of force generated to provide a basis for the discrepancies in previously reported estimates of this relation. It is observed that the search for a single force variability function is of limited value because a variety of functions can emerge according to the constraints imposed on the S during response production. Typically, however, within-S force variability increases at a negatively accelerating rate with equal increments of force produced. Linear scaling of peak force and impulse, as proposed by the pulse-step and motor-output variability models, appears too simplistic to accommodate the manner in which Ss actually achieve reduction in response variability in force production. Rather, there is an individual specific rate of force production that minimizes variability of peak force or impulse for any given set of task constraints.

This study tests between two modern theories of decision making. Rank- and sign-dependent utility (RSDU) models, including cumulative prospect theory (CPT), imply stochastic dominance and two cumulative independence conditions. Configural weight models, with parameters estimated in previous research, predict systematic violations of these properties for certain choices. Experimental data systematically violate all three properties, contrary to RSDU but consistent with configural weight models. This study also tests whether violations of stochastic dominance can be explained by violations of transitivity. Violations of transitivity may be evidence of a dominance detecting mechanism. Although some transitivity violations were observed, most choice triads violated stochastic dominance without violating transitivity. Judged differences between gambles were not consistent with the CPT model. Data were not consistent with the editing principles of cancellation and combination. The main findings are interpreted in terms of coalescing, the principle that equal outcomes can be combined in a gamble by adding their probabilities. RSDU models imply coalescing but configural weight models violate it, allowing configural weighting to explain violations of stochastic dominance and cumulative independence.",2-s2.0-0039472954,3,1999,Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes,0

New research has emerged that suggests there is a troubling relationship between elections and civil wars; primarily, elections increase the risk of civil war recurrence. I investigate this relationship further by examining the economic factors associated with the connection between postwar elections and peace failure. Specifically, how does the presence of oil wealth impact the risk posed by postwar elections. Drawing on previous findings in the democratization literature, I suggest the immobility of oil wealth dramatically increases the stakes associated with postwar elections. As postwar elites use irregular electioneering to consolidate their control of oil revenue, it increases the incentives for postwar opposition to use violence as a means to achieve their objectives. Using post-civil war data from 1945 to 2005, I demonstrate that postwar elections that occur in oil-rich economies dramatically decrease the durability of postwar peace. Once controlling for petro elections, though, I demonstrate that subsequent postwar elections actually increase the durability of postwar peace.",2-s2.0-85018749774,5,2017,Journal of Conflict Resolution,0
2358,86744,Trovato F.,"The Stanley Cup of Hockey and suicide in Quebec, 1951-1992","The Stanley Cup of Hockey and suicide in Quebec, 1951-1992. Social integration theory would view the Stanley Cup of Hockey series as a ceremonial occasion capable of promoting a temporary drop in the incidence of suicide. This proposition is combined with a key postulate of routine activities theory - that people who share similar backgrounds, lifestyles, and interests are inclined to get together in social activities, including in this case watching playoff hockey. It is proposed that the social context surrounding the Stanley Cup constitutes in Quebec a period of increased informal interpersonal contact among the people, and that this should ultimately serve to discourage and/or prevent some potential suicides from occurring. In situations where this type of social context breaks down during the course of the hockey series, suicide is expected to increase temporarily. The analysis reveals that the period comprising the Stanley Cup is by itself not a significant predictor of suicide, though its interactions with sex, age, and marital status are important. During the playoffs (as opposed to other times of the year) young men are in fact more likely to commit suicide, but if they are married, the chances of this happening are reduced significantly. Further analysis indicates that the increased tendency for young men to commit suicide during the hockey series is associated with the situation of when Montreal are ousted early from the competition. The causal mechanisms for this effect are explicated in terms of a premature breakdown of the informal social context associated with the playoffs experience. These results and other features of this study are discussed in relation to previous research regarding sports and mortality.",2-s2.0-0032357348,7,1998,Social Forces,0

Most young citizens start their political lives as habitual nonvoters but they vary in how long it takes to develop into habitual voters. With this transition at the core of the framework, previous findings concerning costs and resources can easily be integrated into developmental theory.

We found that prominent figural cues of grouping, such as good continuation and junction structure, were largely ineffective for image parsing. By contrast, motion cues were of profound significance in that they enabled intraobject integration and facilitated the development of object representations that permitted recognition in static images. Following 10 to 18 months of visual experience, the individuals' performance improved, and they were able to use the previously ineffective static figural cues to correctly parse many static scenes.

The current research shows that having no power can be better than having a little power. Negotiators prefer having some power (weak negotiation alternatives) to having no power (no alternatives). We challenge this belief that having any alternative is beneficial by demonstrating that weak alternatives create low anchors that reduce the value of first offers. In contrast, having no alternatives is liberating because there is no anchor to weigh down first offers. In our experiments, negotiators with no alternatives felt less powerful but made higher first offers and secured superior outcomes compared with negotiators who had weak alternatives. We established the role of anchoring through mediation by first offers and through moderation by showing that weak alternatives no longer led to worse outcomes when negotiators focused on a countervailing anchor or when negotiators faced an opponent with a strong alternative.

In particular, intermediaries facilitate responsive adaptation of the buyers' supplier base to their changing needs while simultaneously ensuring that suppliers behave as if they had long-term sourcing commitments from buying firms. In the face of changing buyer needs, an intermediary that sources on behalf of multiple buyers can responsively change the composition of future business committed to a supplier such that a sufficient level of business comes from the buyer(s) that most prefer this supplier. On the other hand, direct buyers that source only for themselves must provide all their committed business to a supplier from their own sourcing needs, even if they no longer prefer this supplier. Unlike existing theories of intermediation, our theory better explains the observed phenomenon that although transactional barriers and information asymmetries have steadily decreased, the use of intermediaries has soared, even among large companies such as Walmart.",2-s2.0-84866358410,3,2012,Management Science,0

We present an acquisition policy, sampled expected utility (SEU), that employs particular estimations to enable effective ranking of potential acquisitions in settings where relatively little information is available about the underlying domain. We then present experimental results showing that, compared with the policy of using representative sampling for feature acquisition, SEU reduces the cost of producing a model of a desired accuracy and exhibits consistent performance across domains.

The empirical evidence from a sample of pharmaceutical firms entering the new biotech fields indicates that both technological and complementary capabilities potentially affect firms' entry into emerging technologies and entry mode. However, the results also show that capabilities in the traditional technology and the emerging technology have different effects. Firms with capabilities in the emerging technology are more likely to enter new technological fields and more likely to use internal development in doing so. Complementary capabilities also increase the rate of entry into emerging technological fields. However, capabilities in traditional technology are found to be unrelated to the propensity to enter new fields, and to the choice of entry mode. These results are consistent with insights from the literature on dynamic capabilities and evolutionary theory.

Meanwhile the age-adjusted mortality rate from cardiovascular disease fell dramatically. Since the causes that underlie cancer and cardiovascular disease are likely dependent, the decline in mortality rates from cardiovascular disease may partially explain the lack of progress in cancer mortality. Because competing risks models (used to model mortality from multiple causes) are fundamentally unidentified, it is difficult to estimate cancer trends. We derive bounds for aspects of the underlying distributions without assuming that the underlying risks are independent. We then estimate changes in cancer and cardiovascular mortality since 1970.

Public sector expansion translates into worse distributional outcomes in nondemocracies or limited democracies because the state is more inclined to support the development of particular core industries or client populations in urban formal sectors through targeted taxation or transfer systems. On the other hand, the larger public sector size leads to better distributional outcomes in fully institutionalized democracies because the democratic political mechanisms enable the state institutions to be more responsive to the demands of lower classes and more committed to achieving better distributional outcomes. This study demonstrates that democracy is associated with inequality as an institutional background that converts the effects of public sector size on inequality from positive to negative by strengthening the hegemony of equity orientation within state institutions.",2-s2.0-20444447989,7,2005,American Sociological Review,0

A single coherent framework is proposed to synthesize long-standing research on 8 seemingly unrelated cognitive decision-making biases. During the past 6 decades, hundreds of empirical studies have resulted in a variety of rules of thumb that specify how humans systematically deviate from what is normatively expected from their decisions. Several complementary generative mechanisms have been proposed to explain those cognitive biases. Here it is suggested that (at least) 8 of these empirically detected decision-making biases can be produced by simply assuming noisy deviations in the memory-based information processes that convert objective evidence (observations) into subjective estimates (decisions). An integrative framework is presented to show how similar noise-based mechanisms can lead to conservatism, the Bayesian likelihood bias, illusory correlations, biased self-other placement, subadditivity, exaggerated expectation, the confidence bias, and the hard-easy effect. Analytical tools from information theory are used to explore the nature and limitations that characterize such information processes for binary and multiary decision-making exercises. The ensuing synthesis offers formal mathematical definitions of the biases and their underlying generative mechanism, which permits a consolidated analysis of how they are related. This synthesis contributes to the larger goal of creating a coherent picture that explains the relations among the myriad of seemingly unrelated biases and their potential psychological generative mechanisms.

The validity of the 7 tasks and of overall A-DMC emerges in significant relationships with measures of socioeconomic status, cognitive ability, and decision-making styles. Participants who performed better on the A-DMC were less likely to report negative life events indicative of poor decision making, as measured by the Decision Outcomes Inventory. Significant predictive validity remains when controlling for demographic measures, measures of cognitive ability, and constructive decision-making styles.

A representation is always a selective and limited reproduction of the thing represented, an idea captured in the metaphor of a map. What is left out of a representation is as important as what is included. A specifically political conception of representation implies limits to the scope of that conception, the nature and character of the represented constituency, and the relationship between constituent and representative, irrespective of variations in institutional design and practice. The limits of political representation reflect normative commitments; consequently, a focus on those limits is central to an evaluation of representative practices. While it is important to look beyond familiar institutional forms, excessively inclusive descriptions of representative, constituency, or representation deprive those conceptions of their substantive content. The limits of political representation are not defects to be overcome by an ever-expanding definition of representation, they are an essential focus in the normative or empirical analysis of representative institutions and practices.",2-s2.0-84975248755,5,2016,American Political Science Review,0

We examine the forces affecting organized interests' decisions to use particular lobbying tactics to target different legislators in committee, using the group-legislator dyad as our unit of analysis. Two basic assumptions underlie our conceptual model of lobbying strategies in committee. First, organizations have legislative goals of expanding the size of their supportive coalitions and shaping the content of legislative proposals, and an ongoing interest in maintaining themselves. Second, different lobbying tactics are better suited to the achievement of each of these goals. Given these assumptions, the tactics organizations use to lobby individual legislators are expected to depend on (1) groups' perceptions of how legislators may help them to achieve their goals; (2) their policy positions and other characteristics of the issue debate; and (3) groups' resources. Our multinomial logit analysis lends suport to our expectations about the forces that shape the lobbying strategies organizations employ.",2-s2.0-0033229078,5,1999,Journal of Politics,0

Research on the emotional consequences of interactive service work remains inconclusive in large part because scholars have not analyzed the mechanisms that lead frontline employees to adopt the meanings disseminated by their employers. The authors argue that the theoretical framework best suited for remedying this situation is the negotiated order perspective. It suggests that whether employees adopt a corporate-sanctioned meaning, and with what emotional effect, depends on the conjunction of several social conditions. The authors also propose a novel analytical strategy that can identify these conditional pathways and formalize the combinatorial logic of the negotiated order perspective: fuzzy-set techniques. To illustrate the utility of this approach, the article examines a university hospital that has tried to create a more meaningful and emotionally rewarding work environment for its nursing staff.

Acting "" Prosocially"" at the Disadvantage of Others. For centuries economists and psychologists have argued that the morality of moral emotions lies in the fact that they stimulate prosocial behavior and benefit others in a person's social environment. Many studies have shown that guilt, arguably the most exemplary moral emotion, indeed motivates prosocial behavior in dyadic social dilemma situations. When multiple persons are involved, however, the moral and prosocial nature of this emotion can be questioned. The present article shows how guilt can have beneficial effects for the victim of one's actions but also disadvantageous effects for other people in the social environment. A series of experiments, with various emotion inductions and dependent measures, all reveal that guilt motivates prosocial behavior toward the victim at the expense of others around-but not at the expense of oneself. These findings illustrate that a thorough understanding of the functioning of emotions is necessary to understand their moral nature.",2-s2.0-79952081887,6,2011,Journal of Personality and Social Psychology,0

Abstract This article highlights a number of different pedagogical practices that can be used with study abroad programs, both classroom methods and out-of-class techniques. In this particular class - which focused on Estonia's Singing Revolution and included a 10-day trip abroad to Estonia - social media platforms like Twitter and Tumblr were frequently used to create collaboration among students. In addition, Estonian music and pop culture were studied, giving students a unique insight into a culture very foreign from their own. Although Estonia was the focus of this particular class, the results of these methods are generalizable to help others who lead study abroad programs and develop creative ways to foster interaction. This article also demonstrates why social media platforms are helpful to political scientists and the political science discipline more generally.

Belief polarization occurs when 2 people with opposing prior beliefs both strengthen their beliefs after observing the same data. Many authors have cited belief polarization as evidence of irrational behavior. We show, however, that some instances of polarization are consistent with a normative account of belief revision. Our analysis uses Bayesian networks to characterize different kinds of relationships between hypotheses and data, and distinguishes between cases in which normative reasoners with opposing beliefs should both strengthen their beliefs, cases in which both should weaken their beliefs, and cases in which one should strengthen and the other should weaken his or her belief. We apply our analysis to several previous studies of belief polarization and present a new experiment that suggests that people tend to update their beliefs in the directions predicted by our normative account.",2-s2.0-84898663831,6,2014,Psychological Review,0

2402,58328,Larson J.M.,Interethnic conflict and the potential dangers of cross-group ties,"Interethnic conflict and the potential dangers of cross-group ties. Bridging social ties is thought to reduce the likelihood of interethnic violence. This logic has motivated countless development projects and international programs seeking to forge cross-group ties between groups with a conflictual history. However, this article identifies an important mechanism by which certain cross-group ties can make interethnic peace strictly less likely. The results stem from a game-theoretic model which formalizes civil society as a network and relates intergroup cooperation to the particular networks that transmit information from person to person in each group. The model reveals that, first, groups are capable of enforcing cross-group cooperation, even when no cross-group ties are present and the networks within each group are missing links, using peer-enforcement strategies, and their ability to do so depends on the structure of these networks. Second, when attempting to enforce intergroup cooperation, groups with sparse networks may be at risk of a long-lasting series of back-and-forth retaliation that groups with denser networks would avoid. Finally, there exists a mechanism by which some cross-group ties make intergroup cooperation strictly less likely. When interethnic cooperation is enforced by threatening coordinated retaliation for any misbehavior, success depends on expectations about how quickly retaliation can be coordinated and how many will participate in it. Some individuals in a network are in a position to send news to many others quickly; others are not. The latter therefore coordinate retaliation more slowly and would be relatively vulnerable to cross-group defections if they could be identified. Cross-group ties expose the vulnerability and generate incentives to disrupt interethnic peace; cross-group ties between the least embedded individuals in each ethnic group are the most dangerous. Programs seeking to impose ties should avoid exposing this vulnerability without taking steps to mitigate its danger.",2-s2.0-84966775945,5,2016,Journal of Peace Research,0

Baseline characteristics were measured in 1990-1993, intimate reciprocity in 1993, and recorded sickness absences for a 9-year period during 1993-2001. Among women, giving more support than receiving in intimate relationships positively affected subsequent health status, as indicated by fewer sickness absences. Among men, receiving more support than giving predicted fewer absences. These effects remained even after significant covariates were included in the model. Thus, women seem to benefit from giving support in intimate relationships, and men seem to benefit from receiving support in intimate relationships. The findings on women are in line with the esteem enhancement theory. No support was obtained for the equity theory.

Here, in the light of burgeoning, supportive evidence, we reconsider and elaborate this hypothesis, in particular the refinements in our understanding of ventral and dorsal striatal mechanisms underlying goal-directed and habitual drug seeking, the influence of drug-associated Pavlovian-conditioned stimuli on drug seeking and relapse, and evidence for impairments in top-down prefrontal cortical inhibitory control over this behavior. We further review animal and human studies that have begun to define etiological factors and individual differences in the propensity to become addicted to drugs, leading to the description of addiction endophenotypes, especially for cocaine addiction.

However, whether the menu plan can outperform the F.O.B. origin and the uniform delivered plans depends on the specific demand conditions. When demand is linear in price and delivery cost is uniformly distributed, it is shown that the menu plan is substantially more profitable than the F.O.B, origin and the uniform delivered plans and generates at least 96% of the contribution of an optimal plan which sets a profit maximizing price for individual customers based on cost. On the other hand, when demand is a constant elasticity function of price, the menu plan is found to be only marginally superior to the F.O.B, origin plan which generates more profit than the uniform delivered plan.",2-s2.0-0010628589,4,1995,Journal of Retailing,0

However, changes in the variance of popular support for the president may be as politically and substantively important as shifts in the mean. To illustrate how a focus on variance can enrich our understanding of changes in the president's public standing, this analysis examines the effects of the economy and World War II on the variance in popular support for Franklin D. Roosevelt. At the aggregate level, the study shows that high peacetime unemployment and mounting casualties increased the volatility of FDR's standing among federal relief recipients, erstwhile his most consistent base of support. At the individual level, the analysis demonstrates that individuals with conflicting partisan, economic, and war-related considerations for evaluating the president were more variable in their approval of Roosevelt than were other respondents.

In contrast, the restrictive closed rule always leads to inefficiencies. When committees are homogeneous, the situation is different. All equilibria are inefficient regardless of legislative rules, but the closed rule leads to greater informational efficiency than does the open rule. Furthermore, the efficiency gains under the closed rule more than offset distributional losses regardless of the degree of preference divergence. We also examine the incentives provided by the different rules for information acquisition and committee specialization.",2-s2.0-0035533821,5,2001,American Political Science Review,0

Drawing on the dramaturgical concept of 'peripety' ('moment of sudden change'), the article captures how the turnaround came about due to the emergence of the participants' shared conceptualization of the project mission.

Sociology of social stratification and labour market economics have developed in isolation from one another. The present paper attempts to bring these two traditions closer together. The starting point is a critique of the very notion of social “stratification”. A return to Max Weber's idea of “class situation as market situation” and to his concept of “social closure” is advocated. On this basis, a conception of structured social inequality in advanced capitalist societies is developed which is open for conceptual innovations to be taken from labour market economics. A number of approaches to labour market analysis are discussed, and the special significance of several recent contributions related to the so-called “dual labour market theory” is emphasized. This leads up to the construction of a typological model supposed to supersede the traditional notion of social inequality as a system of hierarchically superposed strata. This model comprises eight levels of labour market structuration characterizing structured social inequality in advanced capitalist societies.",2-s2.0-84965573345,7,1980,Sociology,0

Learning from the experiences of others can provide significant benefits for an organization, but it can be difficult to know who has the most useful or applicable knowledge. Knowledge is acquired from many sources: from within the firm; from other firms; or from competitors, customers, suppliers, and channel partners. Managers must decide how to efficiently search through a universe of potential knowledge sources to select the knowledge that will be the most useful to them. This research examines the conditions under which partner similarity enhances knowledge transfer. Previous research has argued that partner similarity influences knowledge sharing through attraction. Building on past work, our research argues that attraction is only one mechanism by which partner similarity affects knowledge transfer and introduces the idea that partner similarity aids the search through a universe of potential knowledge sources. The dimensions of partner similarity that allow more efficient search will facilitate knowledge transfer, while those similarity dimensions that do not aid search will have a less important impact on transfer. Data from both quantitative and qualitative sources support these hypotheses. Quantitative analyses show that strategic similarity emerges as a more important dimension than customer or location similarities as a significant predictor of knowledge transfer. Qualitative interview data show that businesses are conscious of the strategic similarities within their industry and choose transfer partners accordingly.",2-s2.0-0012874688,3,2000,Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes,0

How does an organization functioning in a regulated, monopoly environment transform itself to prepare for hypercompetitive conditions? Two of the regional Bell operating companies (RBOCs) found one answer to that question: create self-contained areas of chaotic activities with the potential to spawn new managerial capabilities and flexibility. After divestiture from AT&T, the RBOCs maintained their local telephone service monopolies, but they all became involved in numerous unregulated activities, such as international expansion. For two of the seven RBOCs, the international activities led to new skills; learning and capabilities developed inside their stodgy bureaucracies. By the early 1990s, the RBOCs' local telephone service was facing dramatic change. Powerful potential entrants such as long-distance, wireless, and cable companies were surrounding and converging on the local telephone service industry through their new wireless licenses, collaborations crossing traditional industry borders, and new network development. The RBOCs saw clear signs of impending hypercompetitive conditions. How the two RBOCs changed over an eight-year period and prepared for hypercompetition illustrates several aspects of Volberda's model of organizational transformation. The two RBOCs proceeded through two parallel trajectories of change, which after several years converged and necessitated reorganization. Only through a major organizational change were the two RBOCs able to redeploy the capabilities acquired from international activities into their regulated core business, thereby creating the flexibility they needed to prepare for advancing hypercompetition. With the imminent removal of regulatory barriers and legal roadblocks to competition in local telephone service in the United States, the RBOCs' flexibility and ability to manage hypercompetition may soon be tested.",2-s2.0-0030487912,3,1996,Organization Science,0

Knowledge embedded in a group's structures and processes can be leveraged to create sustainable advantage for organizations. We propose that knowledge embedded with a transactive memory system (TMS) helps groups apply prior learning to new tasks and develop an abstract understanding of a problem domain, leading to sustained performance. We present a framework for understanding TMSs as learning systems that affect group learning and learning transfer, and we test the major outcomes of the framework in an empirical study. We found that groups with a prior TMS and experience with two tasks in the same domain were more likely to develop an abstract understanding of the principles relevant to the task domain - a critical factor for learning transfer in general. We did not, however, find strong support for our contention that a TMS facilitates learning transfer after experience with only a single task. Further examinations of our findings showed that the extent to which members maintained expertise across tasks influenced the degree of learning transfer, especially for groups whose members had previously developed a TMS with another group. Our findings show that a TMS has broader benefits beyond the task for which it first developed because a TMS affects members' ability to apply prior learning and develop a collective, abstract understanding of the task domain. More generally, our study demonstrates that TMSs influence group learning and learning transfer.

This paper investigates the impact of an online retailer's stock-out policy on consumers' category purchase and choice decisions. We investigate three different policies: (1) stock-outs are immediately visible and there are no replacement suggestions, (2) stock-outs are only visible after purchase attempts and (3) stock-outs are immediately visible but a replacement item is suggested. Results from an online grocery shopping experiment reveal that the adopted stock-out policy has a significant impact on both decisions. Making stock-outs not immediately visible creates confusion and intensifies the consumer's loss experience, thereby reducing the tendency to buy in the category. Suggesting a replacement item, in contrast, facilitates the substitution decision and slightly reduces the purchase cancellation rate. It also substantially increases the suggested item's choice probability. Yet, this effect disappears when higher-priced - suspicious - items are suggested. Overall, these results indicate that online grocery retailers have an interest in pursuing open and convenience-oriented stock-out policies.",2-s2.0-33747820803,4,2006,Journal of Retailing,0

To evaluate the validity of these arguments, I develop and analyze a survey of California voters who faced five complicated insurance reform ballot initiatives. I find that access to a particular class of widely available information shortcuts allowed badly informed voters to emulate the behavior of relatively well informed voters.

The authors develop the argument that, if facing multiple strategic rivals and having failed in past disputes, a state has an incentive to invest in its reputation for resolute behavior by initiating and escalating conflicts. Their focus is then on both general and immediate deterrence, and while it was standard to tie reputation to a deterrer's past, the authors direct the attention to the challenger's reputation as a potential motivator for its conflictual behavior.

Evidence that dissonant cognitions cause compensatory affirmation and abstraction,"Is dissonance reduction a special case of fluid compensation? Evidence that dissonant cognitions cause compensatory affirmation and abstraction. Cognitive dissonance theory shares much in common with other perspectives that address anomalies, uncertainty, and general expectancy violations. This has led some theorists to argue that these theories represent overlapping psychological processes. If responding to dissonance and uncertainty occurs through a common psychological process, one should expect that the behavioral outcomes of feeling uncertain would also apply to feelings of dissonance, and vice versa. One specific prediction from the meaning maintenance model would be that cognitive dissonance, like other expectancy violations, should lead to the affirmation of unrelated beliefs, or the abstraction of unrelated schemas when the dissonant event cannot be easily accommodated. This article presents 4 studies (N = 1124) demonstrating that the classic induced-compliance dissonance paradigm can lead not only to a change of attitudes (dissonance reduction), but also to (a) an increased reported belief in God (Study 2), (b) a desire to punish norm-violators (Study 1 and 3), (c) a motivation to detect patterns amid noise (Study 3), and (d) polarizing support of public policies among those already biased toward a particular side (Study 4). These results are congruent with theories that propose content-general fluid compensation following the experience of anomaly, a finding not predicted by dissonance theory.

We found that print-speech coactivation across the left-hemisphere reading network in beginning readers predicted reading achievement 2 years later beyond the effects of brain activity for either modality alone; moreover, coactivation effects accounted for variance in later reading after controlling for initial reading performance. Within the reading network, effects of coactivation were significant in bilateral inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and left inferior parietal cortex and fusiform gyrus.

High-income consumers, vertical differentiation, and the wage structure. This article considers the effects on the wage structure of the U.S. economy’s growing reliance on demand from high-income consumers. Relative to the mass consumers that defined the post–World War II U.S. economy, high-income consumers are willing to pay for high-quality and high-status products. These spending patterns split producers into up-market and down-market segments and stoke winner-take-all dynamics among up-market producers. Economic dependence on highincome consumers could thus lead to a new form of industrial segmentation, based on vertical differentiation by product quality or status. To test these predictions, data from consumer expenditure and wage surveys are linked using input-output tables and used to fit variance function regressions. Results show that industries more dependent on high-income consumers have greater wage inequality. This analysis identifies a new structural source of wage inequality not considered in previous research: the increasingly unequal composition of consumer demand reproduces wage inequality.",2-s2.0-85021758588,7,2017,American Journal of Sociology,0

The empirical validity of that assumption in psychology is questioned here. Moreover, because Swets used that assumption while generating theoretical ROCs for various measures, discrepancies between those ROCs and empirical ROCs could be due to a lack of the psychological constancy he assumed.

The United Nations Secretary-General's third party role is stated generally in the organization's charter. This basis has been exploited to the extent possible, and sometimes beyond that, by the successive incumbents of this office, whose different styles of operation are briefly described. The Secretary-General does not command economic or physical power, but has to rely on the moral status emanating from the principles of the charter, and on reputed impartiality. Political support from member governments is also important, but he cannot court the favours of any particular geographical or ideological grouping. He cannot operate against the express wish of the Security Council, but the Council depends on the services he can offer as chief executive. The personal skills of the Secretary-General and his staff are crucial to their function. The central position of the UN headquarters in the international diplomatic network is also an important asset. The Secretary-General has the right to place any dispute on the provisional agenda of the Security Council. However, he works mostly behind the scenes if the members of the council are unwilling to discuss a dispute. Most of his time is spent on good offices missions and mediation, sometimes at the request of deliberative organs of the UN, but also frequently on his own initiative. His function may be frustrated, replaced or supplemented by mediation efforts by the major powers. UN peace-keeping missions are often closely linked to mediation (peace-making). The recent improvement in relations between the permanent members of the Security Council has strengthened the role of the Secretary-General as the world's most reputable intermediary.",2-s2.0-84967468842,5,1991,Journal of Peace Research,0

At first glance, the political-theory classroom can seem like a ""philosophy class in disguise."" How can we make our text-based classes more ""political""? This article considers how three teaching formats - debate, fishbowl, and forum theater - enact different types of power in the classroom and how those enactments necessitate political judgments. In addition to creating the need for political analysis, each of these formats embodies a particular rhetorical strategy often used by political theorists. By physicalizing the argumentative, introspective, and descriptive devices that writers of political theory use, students become better readers of these often old and usually dense texts.

2461,59847,"Arosalo U., Väyrynen R.",Financial and Industrial Oligarchy: Present Structure and Some Trends,"Financial and Industrial Oligarchy: Present Structure and Some Trends. The paper contains an analysis, based on the 300 biggest industrial corporations and commercial banks, of the degree of concentration of various types of capital. First some techniques of concen tration are explored. At the transnational level, the most conspicuous phenomenon is the formation of new types of international teams between banks, teams which imply ever-closer ties between banks. Contributing to increasing concentration are the foreign operations - establishment of repre sentative offices and branches - of major banks. Some long-term aspects on the degree of con centration are also touched on. These explorations indicate that the degree of concentration has increased considerably since the beginning of the 20th century. Especially (West) Germany and Great Britain have declined in importance, while countries like the US, Japan, and Italy have increased their financial power. The overall con centration of capital power among nations is marked. In the field of banking and multinational business corporations, the degree of concentration is not so conspicuous, although US banks and BINGOs account for 35-40 % of the total activi ties. Neither is the rank order of various nations completely the same; for example Japan has a more dominant role in banking than in other fields, and Great Britain has gained relatively more dominance in the system of BINGOs. The bulk of the article consists of descriptive analysis of the degree of concentration of capital power and changes in it, but the authors also carry out some explanatory investigations. These investigations indicate, among other things, that the 'free flow' of capital - advocated by OECD - does not change the structure of capital con centration, and that industrial capital alone determines the extent of outflowing capital. Furthermore, the data clearly indicate a division of labor between smaller West European states: relatively speaking, the Netherlands and Switzer land are centers of industrial capital; whereas e.g. Belgium, a political centrum of Western Europe, is much weaker in this respect. The authors also indicate the impact of the war in Vietnam on the banking activities in this region: the most im portant banks of the area have grown very rapidly. This finding is clearly connected with the tendency of finance capital to become involved in large-scale violent conflicts.",2-s2.0-84965502608,5,1973,Journal of Peace Research,0

During early adulthood, individuals from different cultures across the world tend to become more agreeable, more conscientious, and less neurotic. Two leading theories offer different explanations for these pervasive age trends: Five-factor theory proposes that personality maturation is largely determined by genetic factors, whereas social-investment theory proposes that personality maturation in early adulthood is largely the result of normative life transitions to adult roles. In the research reported here, we conducted the first systematic cross-cultural test of these theories using data from a large Internet-based sample of young adults from 62 nations (N = 884,328). We found strong evidence for universal personality maturation from early to middle adulthood, yet there were significant cultural differences in age effects on personality traits.

Using Norwegian registry data, this study addresses the causal impact of immigrant classmates on educational attainment in young adulthood, as well as academic track enrollment and educational achievement in school, within six entire student cohorts in their final tenth grade of compulsory education (310,742 students, 751 schools). Controlling for school fixed effects, native peer characteristics, and observed characteristics of students and their families, we find that students in cohorts with more immigrant peers within the same school have slightly higher propensities to complete upper-secondary education by their early twenties. The effects are about three times stronger among students from immigrant families compared to students with nativeborn parents, and are also robust to adjustment for average grade achievement. Moreover, these peer effects seem to mainly reflect the presence of immigrant classmates from high-achieving origin regions, while we do not find corresponding negative effects of exposure to immigrant classmates from low-achieving origin regions. In conclusion, these results indicate a modest positive influence of exposure to immigrant classmates on, primarily, immigrant students' educational attainment several years later.",2-s2.0-84958682705,7,2015,Social Forces,0

It is suggested that in the most common ease of retrieval paradigm, when it is difficult for people to generate or retrieve the specific type of cognition requested (e.g., positive thoughts about an issue or memories of assertive behavior), they are more likely to spontaneously generate or retrieve unrequested cognitions (e.g., negative thoughts about the issue or memories of unassertive behavior), and the presence of these unrequested cognitions can affect social judgment. In 4 experiments, participants were asked to generate a high (difficult) or low (easy) number of cognitions in a given direction. Across experiments, when participants were asked to generate a high number of cognitions, they also had more unrequested cognitions, and these unrequested cognitions played a mediating role in the ease of retrieval effect on judgment.

Even after an extremely coarse visual presentation of 100 milliseconds, the product and brand in typical ads are identified well above chance levels, with atypical ads doing slightly better at the brand level. We propose a new metric that quantifies how effectively individual ads communicate their gist in adverse exposure conditions and that predicts the immediate interest that ads draw. Bayesian mediation analyses show that because of their better gist performance, typical ads rather than atypical ones raise immediate interest after very brief exposures. These findings challenge some of the received knowledge in advertising theory and practice, and they reveal the immediate communication benefits of typical ads.",2-s2.0-84857182471,4,2012,Marketing Science,0

Real-time response (RTR) measurement is an important technique for analyzing human processing of electronic media stimuli. Although it has been demonstrated that RTR data are reliable and internally valid, some argue that they lack external validity. The reason for this is that RTR measurement is restricted to a laboratory environment due to its technical requirements. This paper introduces a smartphone app that 1) captures real-time responses using the dial technique and 2) provides a solution for one of the most important problems in RTR measurement, the (automatic) synchronization of RTR data. In addition, it explores the reliability and validity of mobile RTR measurement by comparing the real-time reactions of two samples of young and welleducated voters to the 2013 German televised debate. Whereas the first sample participated in a classical laboratory study, the second sample was equipped with our mobile RTR system and watched the debate at home. Results indicate that the mobile RTR system yields similar results to the lab-based RTR measurement, providing evidence that laboratory studies using RTR are externally valid. In particular, the argument that the artificial reception situation creates artificial results has to be questioned. In addition, we conclude that RTR measurement outside the lab is possible. Hence, mobile RTR opens the door for large-scale studies to better understand the processing and impact of electronic media content.",2-s2.0-84979072321,5,2016,Public Opinion Quarterly,0

We find that individual franchisees are much more likely to be assigned the ownership of a particular new unit the closer their existing units are geographically to the new unit. Further, given distance, franchisees are more likely to be allocated a new franchised unit if they already own units whose markets are contiguous and demographically similar to that of the new unit.

We find that relatively efficient firms become exporters; however, in most industries, firms' costs are not affected by previous exporting activities.

Extant studies also conduct statistical analyses on overly aggregated data, masking any effect terrorism has on important bargaining outcomes.

In this paper we examine how identification with particular social foci within organizations influences the propensity of advice-seeking ties to crosscut the boundaries of organizational subunits. We propose and test a theory of relationship formation based on the strength of organizational members' identification with social foci. We expect that advice relations of organizational members identifying more strongly with local foci (organizational subunits) will be more likely to be contained within their boundaries. By contrast, we expect that advice relations of organizational members identifying more strongly with a global focus (the organization as a whole) will be more likely to crosscut the boundaries defined around local foci.

Results show that identification with social foci affects the formation of crosscutting network ties over and above the effect of the formal organizational boundaries that encircle the foci. More specifically, we find that organizational members who identify strongly with local foci (subsidiaries, in our case) tend to seek advice within such local foci, whereas organizational members who identify strongly with a global focus (corporate, in our case) tend to be sources of advice across the boundaries of the local foci in which they participate. Cross-boundary advice ties are less likely to occur among managers who identify strongly with their subsidiaries but weakly with the corporate group. As a consequence, identification with local foci constrains knowledge transfer relations within the boundaries of such foci. On the contrary, cross-boundary advice ties are more likely to occur among managers who identify strongly with the corporate group but weakly with their subsidiary. As a consequence, identification with a global focus activates knowledge transfer across the boundaries of local foci.",2-s2.0-84897887462,3,2014,Organization Science,0

We examine the robustness of information cascades in laboratory experiments. Apart from the situation in which each player can obtain a signal for free (as in the experiment by Anderson and Holt (1997), American Economic Reviev, 87 (5), 847-862), the case of costly signals is studied where players decide whether or not to obtain private information, at a small but positive cost. In the equilibrium of this game, only the first player buys a signal and makes a decision based on this information whereas all following players do not buy a signal and herd behind the first player. The experimental results show that too many signals we bought and the equilibrium prediction performs poorly. To explain these observations, the depth of the subjects' reasoning process is estimated, using a statistical error-rate model. Allowing for different error rates on different levels of reasoning, we find that the subjects, inferences become significantly more noisy on higher levels of the thought process, and that only short chains of reasoning are applied by the subjects.",2-s2.0-11144357762,2,2004,Review of Economic Studies,0

Dispositional sources of job satisfaction have been the subject of recent research in the organizational sciences. Problems in much of this research, which limit the conclusions one can draw from the results, are discussed. This study makes a distinction between affective disposition, defined as the tendency to respond generally to the environment in an affect-based manner, and subjective well-being, the level of overall happiness and satisfaction an individual has with his or her life. Affective disposition was hypothesized to lead to subjective well-being, and subjective well-being and job satisfaction were hypothesized to be mutually causal. A causal model was tested employing two different sources of data: self-reports and ""significant other"" evaluations. This biangulation of sources of data and estimation of nonrecursive relationships removes some problems often assumed to plague results based on single-source data. Results indicated support for the overall hypothesized causal model and supported a dispositional influence on job attitudes. The influences are more complex than past research has suggested.",2-s2.0-43949162295,3,1993,Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes,0

We suggest that this functioning yet numb subject is well suited to neoliberal demands, where the informants respond to outer demands without challenging them. Inspired by Chantal Mouffe we suggest that depression as a diagnosis is depoliticising, and with Ian Craib, we can see a denial of disappointment that surfaces in how depression is related to contemporary society. As a possible form of resistance we identify the strong positive emphasis on emotions as giving direction, motivating the interviewees to stop medicating.

Considerable research demonstrates that the depletion of self-regulatory resources impairs performance on subsequent tasks that demand these resources. The current research sought to assess the impact of perceived resource depletion on subsequent task performance at both high and low levels of actual depletion. The authors manipulated perceived resource depletion by having participants 1st complete a depleting or nondepleting task before being presented with feedback that did or did not provide a situational attribution for their internal state. Participants then persisted at a problem-solving task (Experiments 1-2), completed an attention-regulation task (Experiment 3), or responded to a persuasive message (Experiment 4). The findings consistently demonstrated that individuals who perceived themselves as less (vs. more) depleted, whether high or low in actual depletion, were more successful at subsequent self-regulation. Thus, perceived regulatory depletion can impact subsequent task performance-and this impact can be independent of one's actual state of depletion.",2-s2.0-76449086109,6,2010,Journal of Personality and Social Psychology,0

It is well established in the marketing literature that the bond of trust is a cornerstone of interorganizational relationships. However, trust is considered to be context-specific, as it is difficult to endow on new relationships. We argue that the existing trust between organizations not only survives tough and shifting times, but also helps steer those organizations through such trying periods. We investigated a context where a major change was instituted in a cooperative marketing channel. Here, the supplier (the focal channel member) had to convince the other channel members (the retailers) about the impending merger, which may or may not bring benefits to all. We empirically show the existing trust in the supplier was a major determinant of the support for the merger and inducing the post-merger trust in and commitment to the changed supplier.",2-s2.0-0344154605,4,2003,Journal of Retailing,0

The mobility of individual managers has long presented a problem for firms in knowledge-intensive industries. Shifting to more complex work often reduces the importance of a single individual's knowledge for the firm's exchange relationships because complex work requires inputs from a broader set of the firm's members. Although complex work decreases the likelihood that a single individual can shift the exchange relationship to another firm, we propose that it increases the vulnerability of the firm's performance to departures of those individual managers who act as coordinators of knowledge. This leads us to focus on how the internal knowledge network formed to maintain each relationship can compound or mitigate the loss of a coordinating manager. Using original data on client relationships from a law firm, we examine the effect of internal knowledge networks and lead partner departures on the performance of the relationships. Supporting our argument, we find that the negative performance effect of a lead partner departure is greater when the network has high knowledge heterogeneity and involves more experts and lower when the network has high cohesion.",2-s2.0-84983042554,3,2016,Management Science,0

When survey researchers are interested in measuring the personal values of respondents, they often use a rating rather than a ranking method because it is easier and faster to administer and yields data that are amenable to parametric statistical analyses. However, because personal values are inherently positive constructs, respondents often exhibit little differentiation among the values and end-pile their ratings toward the positive end of the scale. Such lack of differentiation may potentially affect the statistical properties of the values and the ability to detect relationships with other variables. Two experiments were conducted via mail surveys to general population samples to test alter-native rating methods designed to increase differentiation and reduce end-piling in the rating of personal values. The results suggest that a procedure in which respondents first pick their most and least important values, then rate them (most-least), provides more differentiation and less end-piling than a simple rating procedure (rate-only). Increased differentiation for the most-least method influenced the fit of latent structure and resulted in more robust relations between the values ratings and other criterion variables. These results generalized across type of values scale, number of values rated, and number of rating points.",2-s2.0-0034257506,5,2000,Public Opinion Quarterly,0

These methods lead the search for general principles away from idealized representations and towards selective processes. Putting cultural evolution central in understanding language diversity makes learning fundamental in the cognition of language: increasingly powerful models of general learning, paired with channelled caregiver input, seem set to manage language acquisition without recourse to any innate universal grammar. Understanding why human language has no clear parallels in the animal world requires a cross-species perspective: crucial ingredients are vocal learning (for which there are clear non-primate parallels) and an intention-attributing cognitive infrastructure that provides a universal base for language evolution.

However, the positive association is moderated by contextual factors that influence whether these directors reflect the expectations of the corporate elite or the efficient directorial labor market. Specifically, this study shows that the association becomes more positive when these directors are highly embedded in the corporate elite network or have shorter board tenure but less positive when independent chief executive officer directors' equity ownership is high. We also found a crossover interaction effect where the association is negative (positive) when firm performance is low (high).

The communicative advantages of weak ties are examined, applying structural analysis methods. The tendency of weak ties towards intransitivity and low multiplexity, is suggested to account for their frequent activation as inter-group bridges. The findings highlight the potential of social network analysis as a bridge between micro-level interaction and macro-level patterns including diffusion of innovation, formation of public opinion and social solidarity. Weak ties serve as the crucial paths between groups, thus providing the means by which individual behavior and ideas, originating in small face-to-face groups, are routinized and agglomerated into large-scale patterns.",2-s2.0-0009182483,7,1983,Social Networks,0

The encyclopedic inventory of the first half of the twentieth century, ""Anthropology Today"", published in 1953, gave little inkling that within a few decades developing trends in social theory, in field experience, in electronic data processing, and in mathematics would combine to bring to prominence a distinctive theoretical approach using a quite formal network model for social systems. Now, sophisticated mathematics and computer programming permit sophisticated network models - networks seen as sets of links, networks seen as generated structures, and networks seen as flow processes. Although network thinking has shown a dramatic rise from the ""Anthropology Today"" of 1953 to the current anthropology of 1978, it is predicted to soar in the next quarter century, much of the weighty burden of network analysis having been lifted from us by ever more rapid electronic data processing.",2-s2.0-0002593580,7,1978,Social Networks,0

This study employs a Foucauldian feminist lens to analyze how organizational and gendered discourses are quite literally written upon women's bodies in ways that often constrain women's professional identities. Nineteen professional women were interviewed about their definitions and experiences of their professional bodies. The interview data are summarized in the following three emergent and telling themes: (1) a professional body is a fit body; (2) a professional body (purposefully) emits signs and messages through bodily comportment, nonverbal behaviours, and performances. Thus, the body is conceived as a text to be read; and, (3) a professional woman's body is positioned as excess(ively) sexual. The task of controlling the female body is made more difficult because the female body has a tendency to overflow. The undisciplined, excessive body points to the female body's otherness. These three themes indicate how professional women's bodies are normalized and made docile in organizational contexts. Additionally, the interview data imply that both men and women are disciplinarians. Finally, the political implications of women's embodied professional identities are discussed and future research directions are presented.",2-s2.0-0037744126,3,1999,Organization Studies,0

Consumer choice is often based on the relative visual appeal of competing products. Lay intuition, common marketing practice, and extant literature all suggest that more visual impressions help consumers distinguish products. This research shows that the opposite can occur. Rather than highlighting differences, seeing more pictures of products being compared can obfuscate perceptions, reduce distinctiveness and attractiveness of products, and increase choice uncertainty. Six experiments demonstrate that this ""product-agnosia"" effect is driven by shifts in the perceptual focus level of visual information processing. More visual impressions increased component-oriented and decreased gestalt-oriented perceptual focus, which undermined the distinctiveness of products distinguished on a gestalt level (e.g., by style). The effect reversed for products distinguished on a component level (e.g., by technical features). Overall, the efficacy of ""showing more"" depended on matching consumers' visual-processing style and the level (gestalt vs. component) at which products are differentiated.",2-s2.0-84904206271,4,2014,Journal of Consumer Research,0

To attract potential customers, retailers often advertise low prices with appeals such as ""Prices start at $49"" or ""One week in the Caribbean from $449."" These appeals are deliberately vague in the sense that they give little information about the product to which the prices refer. The author offers an explanation of how such advertisements can construct a credible price image even with this vagueness. When retailers must incur costs in the process of selling a product, advertising low prices to lure potential consumers can backfire. This is because attracting too many consumers who are less likely to purchase the retailer's higher-priced products on the basis of vague promises imposes unwanted selling costs but yields little extra revenue. Therefore, a store with a relatively high selling cost will be dissuaded from attempting to use such a strategy. The author shows analytically that such advertising can be credible only when there is a substantial difference in retailers' costs or when the selling cost is high.",2-s2.0-24344479671,4,2005,Journal of Marketing Research,0

In Experiment 1, in spite of posing explicit questions concerning Asian-White and Black-White targets, hypodescent was observed in both cases and more strongly in Black-White social categorization. Experiments 2A and 2B used a speeded response task and again revealed evidence of hypodescent in both cases, as well as a stronger effect in the Black-White target condition. In Experiments 3A and 3B, social perception was studied with a face-morphing task. Participants required a face to be lower in proportion minority to be perceived as minority than in proportion White to be perceived as White. Again, the threshold for being perceived as White was higher for Black-White than for Asian-White targets.

In the first half of the essay, I examine exactly what it is that the social contract is thought to have created and propose in that context a fundamental distinction, shared by Hobbes and Rousseau, between an authorizing entity that constitutes the legitimate foundation of the state and an instrumental entity the activity of which has been legitimated by the former.

Such was not always the case: many of the field's foundational studies relied on information that would not pass muster under current standards governing data collection. We crossvalidate a model from one of these studies (Epstein, Walker, and Dixon 1989), which relied heavily on data collected by Schubert (1976), with data derived from the Spaeth Data Base. The crossvalidation was only a partial success, with a key variable (prior behavior) failing to obtain statistical significance. While this finding may carry important implications for scholarship on Supreme Court decision making, the more general lesson of our effort is this: Simply because judicial specialists (or those in other fields for that matter) now have outstanding public data bases, it does not follow that they can ignore issues of measurement, reproducibility, reliability, and verification. Too many of the seminal studies and important constructs evolved from data bases that were something short of outstanding.

This paper explores three central strategies for pooling surveys and other information to better understand both the state of an election and what can be expected when voters head to the polls. Aggregation, predictive modeling, and hybrid models are assessed as ways of improving on the results of individual surveys. For each method, central questions, key choices, applications, and considerations for use are discussed. Trade-offs in choices between pooling strategies are considered, and the accuracies of each set of strategies for forecasting results in 2012 are compared. Although hybrid models have the potential to most accurately pool election information and make predictions, the simplicity of aggregations and the theory-testing capacity of predictive models can sometimes prove more valuable.",2-s2.0-84942105380,5,2015,Public Opinion Quarterly,0

The rapid rise of alternative organisations such as social enterprises is largely due to the promotional activities of intermediary organisations. So far, little is known about the affective nature of such activities. The present article thus investigates how intermediary organisations make social entrepreneurship palatable for a broader audience by establishing it as an object of desire. Drawing on affect-oriented extensions of Laclau and Mouffe’s poststructuralist theory, hegemonisation is suggested as a way of understanding how social entrepreneurship is articulated through a complementary process of signification and affective investment. Specifically, by examining Austrian intermediaries, we show how social entrepreneurship is endowed with a sense of affective thrust that is based on three interlocking dynamics: the articulation of fantasies such as ‘inclusive exclusiveness’, ‘large-scale social change’ and ‘pragmatic solutions’; the repression of anxiety-provoking and contentious issues (constitutive quiescences); as well as the use of conceptually vague, floating signifiers (moments of indeterminacy). Demonstrating that the hegemonisation of social entrepreneurship involves articulating certain issues whilst, at the same time, omitting others, or rendering them elusive, the article invites a counter-hegemonic critique of social entrepreneurship, and, on a more general level, of alternative forms of organising, that embraces affect as a driving force of change, while simultaneously affirming the impossibility of harmony and wholeness.",2-s2.0-84989915564,3,2016,Organization Studies,0
2550,35854,Matsuyama K.,Beyond icebergs: Towards a theory of biased globalization,"Beyond icebergs: Towards a theory of biased globalization. In contrast to domestic trade, international trade inherently requires more intensive use of skilled labour with expertise in areas such as international business, language skills, and maritime insurance, and the transoceanic transportation is more capital intensive than the local transportation. In the presence of such bias in factor demands, globalization caused by an improvement in the export technologies can lead to a worldwide increase in the relative prices of the factors used intensively in international trade. Furthermore, a worldwide increase in the factors used intensively in international trade can lead to globalization. To capture these effects, we develop a flexible approach to model costly international trade, which includes the standard iceberg approach as a special case. More specifically, we extend the Ricardian model of trade with a continuum of goods by introducing multiple factors of production and by making technologies of supplying goods depend on whether the destination is home or abroad. If the technologies of supplying the same good to the two destinations differ only in total factor productivity, the model becomes isomorphic to the Ricardian model with the iceberg cost. By allowing the two technologies to differ in the factor intensities, our approach enables us to examine the links between factor endowments, factor prices, and globalization that cannot be captured by the iceberg approach.",2-s2.0-33846005124,2,2007,Review of Economic Studies,0

Ceasefires are often seen as a simple measure to end violence and allow more substantive negotiations to begin. Contemporary conflict resolution models thus posit the ceasefire as a basic step in the peacebuilding trajectory. Offering an in-depth analysis of Naga militancy in Northeast India, this article argues that ceasefires should rather be understood as a part of the dynamics of conflict. Northeast India is a site of protracted conflict involving multiple contestants, where Naga militant organizations play a key role. A string of ceasefires since 1997 between the Indian government and the National Socialist Council of Nagalim (NSCN) has contained fighting between security forces and militants, while violence has continued unabated between NSCN factions and among an array of other armed groups in the area claimed as 'Nagalim', with serious consequences for local communities. This study suggests that ceasefires may impact on conflict dynamics in at least three ways, all interrelated: (1) by affecting the internal cohesion of belligerent groups, (2) by affecting the operational space of armed groups, and (3) by affecting the relations between multiple stakeholders and parties to a conflict, including but not limited to the challenger(s) and the state. The study concludes that the terms of ceasefire agreements, the strategic use of ceasefires by conflict actors, and the opportunities created by a lack of effective monitoring of ceasefire ground rules has facilitated the operations of militants vying for territory, revenues from illegal 'taxation' and political stakes. Ceasefires have also paved the way for an escalation of factional and intergroup fighting and violent politics in Northeast India, by empowering signatory groups versus contenders as well as nonviolent actors.",2-s2.0-82255176987,5,2011,Journal of Peace Research,0

Results from a comprehensive panel of U.S. multinational corporations (MNCs) reveal that conventional arguments about poor performance hold for both related and unrelated firm operations in countries characterized by low growth, policy stability, and exchange rate stability. However, the results also show that there are significant differences across the divestment decisions of firms for their related and unrelated foreign operations in countries characterized by high growth, policy instability, and exchange rate volatility. Although poor performance has been called the most significant predictor of divestment, this paper considers how interactions across multilevel factors influence the divestment decisions of firms and reveals how U.S. MNCs respond to both product and geographic market characteristics when making divestment decisions for their foreign operations.",2-s2.0-84873325240,3,2013,Organization Science,0

To better understand human and chimpanzee personality evolution, we obtained trait ratings of personality for 154 captive bonobos (~80% of the U.S. and European population). We found factors that we labeled Assertiveness, Conscientiousness, Openness, Agreeableness, Attentiveness, and Extraversion. The interrater reliabilities and test-retest reliabilities for these factors were comparable to those found in humans and other species. Using orthogonal targeted Procrustes rotations, we compared the bonobo dimensions with those of three samples of captive chimpanzees. Overall congruence coefficients indicated a fair degree of similarity; at the factor level, there was good evidence for Assertiveness, Conscientiousness, Openness, and Agreeableness in the chimpanzee samples; evidence for Attentiveness and Extraversion was poor. These findings suggest that, as expected given their close phylogenetic relationship, bonobo personality structure resembles chimpanzee personality structure in some respects. However, divergent evolution, perhaps as a result of socioecological differences between bonobos and chimpanzees, also appears to have shaped personality structure in these species.",2-s2.0-84957577259,6,2015,Psychological Science,0

Prior studies hypothesize that managers intending to undertake an MBO have an incentive to manage earnings downward to reduce the purchase price. We hypothesize that managers also face a conflicting reporting incentive associated with their efforts to obtain external financing for the MBO and to lower their financing cost. Consistent with our hypothesis, we find that managers who rely the most on external funds to finance their MBOs tend to report less negative abnormal accrual prior to the MBOs. In addition, the relation between external financing and abnormal accruals is tempered when there are more fixed assets that can serve as collateral for debt financing.",2-s2.0-61849119633,3,2008,Management Science,0

In analyzing labor unions' responses to family concerns, this paper makes three arguments. First, analyses of unions force us to shift our perspective. Many union officials insist that work-family issues should include not only what have become the conventional benefits in the work-family literature (like family leave, childcare, and alternative work schedules), but also health benefits, vacation time, and a broad range of issues that are usually excluded from such analyses. By reinvigorating the class component, this change in focus shifts our understanding not only of what policies should be included, but also whom the policies can and do serve. Second, unionization cannot be treated as a dichotomy, but rather requires a more nuanced analysis. Our interviews revealed striking differences among unions, with regard to the more conventional work-family benefits, including flextime, childcare and the FMLA Finally, we argue that not only cultural factors (like member expectations), but also structural factors, including the gender of the membership and leadership, as well as union strength, help explain why such variation among unions exists.",2-s2.0-0035343816,7,2001,Social Problems,0

The stop-signal paradigm is a popular method for examining response inhibition and impulse control in psychology, cognitive neuroscience, and clinical domains because it allows the estimation of the covert latency of the stop process: the stop-signal reaction time (SSRT). In three sets of simulations, we examined to what extent SSRTs that were estimated with the popular mean and integration methods were influenced by the skew of the reaction time distribution and the gradual slowing of the response latencies. We found that the mean method consistently overestimated SSRT. The integration method tended to underestimate SSRT when response latencies gradually increased. This underestimation bias was absent when SSRTs were estimated with the integration method for smaller blocks of trials. Thus, skewing and response slowing can lead to spurious inhibitory differences.

Analysis of data from Prussia, Switzerland, and the Netherlands affords no support for the view that there is less suicide in Catholic than in non-Catholic populations. The apparent differential between them can readily be attributed to a greater tendency within Catholic populations to register suicide as something else - most commonly as either accidental death, ‘sudden’ death, or death of unknown cause. This raises doubts not only about Durkheim's theories concerning suicide but also about other causal theories concerning this phenomenon that rely on a sociological, as contrasted with a psychological (or even idiosyncratic) frame of reference.",2-s2.0-84970404158,7,1987,Sociology,0

We report that children at family risk of dyslexia experience delayed language development as infants and toddlers. In the preschool period, they have significant difficulties in phonological processes as well as with broader language skills and in acquiring the foundations of decoding skill (letter knowledge, phonological awareness and rapid automatized naming [RAN]). Findings are mixed with regard to auditory and visual perception: they do not appear subject to slow motor development, but lack of control for comorbidities confounds interpretation. Longitudinal studies of outcomes show that children at family risk who go on to fulfil criteria for dyslexia have more severe impairments in preschool language than those who are defined as normal readers, but the latter group do less well than controls. Similarly at school age, family risk of dyslexia is associated with significantly poor phonological awareness and literacy skills. Although there is no strong evidence that children at family risk are brought up in an environment that differs significantly from that of controls, their parents tend to have lower educational levels and read less frequently to themselves. Together, the findings suggest that a phonological processing deficit can be conceptualized as an endophenotype of dyslexia that increases the continuous risk of reading difficulties; in turn its impact may be moderated by protective factors.",2-s2.0-84954357743,6,2016,Psychological Bulletin,0

The illustrative context we choose for our simulations is intra-organizational surveying (within which attitudes toward constructs such as employee engagement, job satisfaction, or organizational climate are commonly polled), although the results and implications extend to any survey with metrically consonant item response scales. The simulations identify population and response pattern combinations that are either susceptible or relatively immune to bias.

The authors examine the effects of using a subtractive versus an additive option-framing method on consumers' option choice decisions in three studies. The former option-framing method presents consumers with a fully loaded product and asks them to delete options they do not want. The latter presents them with a base model and asks them to add the options they do want. Combined, the studies support the managerial attractiveness of the subtractive versus the additive option-framing method. Consumers tend to choose more options with a higher total option price when they use subtractive versus additive option framing. This effect holds across different option price levels (Study 1) and product categories of varying price (Study 2). Moreover, this effect is magnified when subjects are asked to anticipate regret from their option choice decisions (Study 2). However, option framing has a different effect on the purchase likelihood of the product category itself, depending on the subject's initial interest in buying within the category. Although subtractive option framing offers strong advantages to managers when product commitment is high, it appears to demotivate category purchase when product commitment is low (Study 3). In addition, the three studies reveal several other findings about the attractiveness of subtractive versus additive option framing from the standpoint of consumers and managers. These findings, in turn, offer interesting public policy and future research implications.",2-s2.0-0034178563,4,2000,Journal of Marketing Research,0

In fact, Pike's multiple-observations model itself predicts a monotonic decreasing latency function. Second, the latency function hypothesis is not jeopardized by the finding, obtained in certain studies, that response latency may be longer for correct than for incorrect responses in a yes-no signal detection task; these data very likely reflect the presence of a secondary functional relationship that counteracts the effect predicted by the latency function hypothesis.

The frequency of the advertising pulse is shown to depend on the magnitude of the market share retention rate (state dependence); the higher it is, the less frequent the advertising.

One such assumption, that political actors use identical conjectures when assessing others' strategies, is nested within applications of widely used game-theoretic equilibrium concepts. When empirical findings call this assumption into question, the self-confirming equilibrium (SCE) concept provides an alternate criterion for theoretical claims.

We show that the claim depends on the assumption that jurors have identical beliefs about one another's types and identical conjectures about one another's strategies. When jurors' beliefs and conjectures vary in ways documented by empirical jury research, fewer false convictions can occur in equilibrium.

As a consequence, the commission fee from selling a house will differ dramatically across cities depending on the average price of housing, although the effort necessary to match buyers and sellers may not be that different. We use a simple economic model to show that if barriers to entry are low, the entry of real estate agents in cities with high housing prices is socially inefficient. Consistent with our model, we find that when the average price of land in a city increases, (1) the fraction of real estate brokers in a city increases, (2) the productivity of an average real estate agent (houses sold per hour worked) falls, and (3) the real wage of a typical real estate agent remains unchanged. We cannot completely rule out the alternative explanation that these results reflect unmeasured differences in the quality of broker services.

Extant literature on anchoring demonstrates that priming affects willingness-to-pay (WTP), but it mainly focuses on average WTP values, neglecting the aggregate effects of priming on WTP distributions. In this research, we argue that when priming is in effect, WTP distribution rather than the average should be analyzed because important pricing decisions, such as optimal price determination or price customization, require an assessment of distributions. Therefore, the objective of this research is to uncover how priming affects WTP distributions and, consequently, the demand curve. The results of these two studies suggest that priming affects not only the average but also the whole distribution and that this effect is in the form of a shift/stretch to the right for high-priming manipulations and to the left for low-priming manipulations.",2-s2.0-84901402157,4,2014,Marketing Letters,0

A Preliminary Taxonomy. Developmental researchers have neglected the study of personality traits in middle childhood, thus leaving unanswered many questions about childhood personality structure. This article presents a developmental framework for understanding personality in middle childhood and critically reviews 5 models of temperament and personality structure in this age range: the models of A. Thomas and S. Chess, A. H. Buss and R. Plomin, M. K. Rothbart, J. Block and J. H. Block, and the Big Five. A number of robust personality dimensions common to these models and the broader developmental and adult personality literatures are then discussed: sociability, social inhibition, dominance, negative emotionality, aggressiveness, prosocial disposition, persistence/attention, mastery motivation, inhibitory control, and activity level. These dimensions represent a preliminary taxonomy of personality traits for exploring questions of individual development in childhood.",2-s2.0-0032214244,6,1998,Psychological Bulletin,0

The assessment of depression in patients with brain pathologies - a topic of considerable clinical and research interest - is complicated by a variety of factors. Among the most problematic are cognitive consequences of brain injury that can diminish the reliability and validity of information used to diagnose depression, determine its severity, ascertain its predictors, and evaluate its impact. In this article, the authors examine the challenges to depression assessment in patients who have had a stroke, the neurologically impaired population in which it has been most frequently studied. Focusing on poststroke depression research, they describe methodological limitations that may contribute to conflicting outcomes and conclusions and offer suggestions for improving the specificity, consistency, validity, and reliability of assessment methods and procedures when investigating depression in patients with brain pathologies.

This paper examines institutional entrepreneurship in the development of China's environmental protection system (EPS) over a period of almost 30 years. China's EPS evolved in four main stages, the boundaries of which were marked by transition-critical events. Within each stage, institutional entrepreneurs conducted activities that supported trajectories of field development. These activities are analysed according to the way they contributed to the construction of regulative, normative and cognitive institutional system pillars. The formation of the EPS as an organizational field in China was characterized by a 'made order' in which the regulative system came first and the state and its agencies dominated the process as the principal institutional entrepreneurs. In this respect it contrasts with the evolution of the same field in the USA. Copyright",2-s2.0-34250366298,3,2007,Organization Studies,0

Zygmunt Bauman's metaphor of liquid modernity addresses the juxtaposition of increased freedom and mobility with accelerated anxiety in an era of deregulated consumption. His proposal that this emergent condition represents a transition from solid to liquid modernity requires closer scrutiny. If solid modernity concerns new forms of engagement consequent to the breakup of old ones, does liquidity necessarily suggest a process of disembedding without any prospect for re-embedding? This question raises the need to address the plausibility of liquidity as an irreversible process. To treat changes in contemporary society as liquid radicalizes fluidity but it fails to provide recognition for the possibility of re-solidification. Data from some recent studies of race, class and religion suggest such a possibility and the need to re-evaluate the notion of liquidity.",2-s2.0-80051814015,7,2011,Sociology,0

Smartphones have become a prevalent technology as they provide employees with instant access to work-related information and communications outside of the office. Despite these advantages, there may be some costs of smartphone use for work at night. Drawing from ego depletion theory, we examined whether smartphone use depletes employees' regulatory resources and impairs their engagement at work the following day. Across two studies using experience sampling methodology, we found that smartphone use for work at night increased depletion the next morning via its effects on sleep. Morning depletion in turn diminished daily work engagement. The indirect effects of smartphone use on depletion and engagement the next day were incremental to the effects of other electronic devices (e.g., computer, tablet, and television use). We also found some support that the negative effects of morning depletion on daily work engagement may be buffered by job control, such that depletion impairs work engagement only for employees who experience low job control.",2-s2.0-84894311222,3,2014,Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes,0
2612,44112,Tsui-Auch L.S.,Unpacking regional ethnicity and the strength of ties in shaping ethnic entrepreneurship,"Unpacking regional ethnicity and the strength of ties in shaping ethnic entrepreneurship. This study is based on an interpretive content analysis of oral history data and documentary data on ethnic Indian and Chinese entrepreneurs in Singapore and their enterprises. This data is complemented by personal interviews with family members, informants and business community leaders, as well as historical analysis. The data reveals that most ethnic Indian entrepreneurs maintained their trade specializations and family management, whereas most ethnic Chinese entrepreneurs pursued unrelated diversification and incorporated outsiders into their operational management over time. What is particularly intriguing is the existence of an intra-ethnic division in business structure among the ethnic Indian enterprises. I argue that the opportunity structure in the country of residence and ethnic resources play only a limited role in shaping the differential management and business structures of the two ethnic groups. Rather, I attribute such differences primarily to the differential strength of ties of the entrepreneurs to their region/dialect-based networks. The strength of the ties reflects the degree of intra-community homogeneity and inter-community heterogeneity. These arguments are presented in the form of hypothesized relationships for future validation. The paper concludes with a critique of the structuralist, culturalist and interactionist perspectives on ethnic entrepreneurship, and suggests directions for future research into intra-ethnic entrepreneurship, comparative business systems and the paradox of embeddedness.

This study aims to uncover how horizontal inequality affects support for violent and nonviolent resistance among Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza. National survey data are introduced to operationalize the mechanisms proposed in the horizontal inequality literature on the individual level. Results point to the operation of political and economic horizontal inequality mechanisms in the Palestinian case. Higher perceived status of civil and political rights is associated with a lower probability of supporting violent over nonviolent resistance. Individuals are also more likely to support violent over nonviolent resistance the larger the difference in household expenditure and consumer durable ownership between their own region and the closest Israeli subdistrict. Corresponding differences in educational attainment have no corresponding effect. The results demonstrate how economic and political horizontal inequality can increase the risk that an individual becomes part of the mobilizational potential of violent social movements. This can lead to participation in a wide range of supportive actions that increase the viability of such movements, ranging from material support to direct participation in violence.

Next, the model is applied to Information Resources Inc. panel data.

The effect is greatest when Republicans are the incumbent party, but Democrats benefit from unemployment even when they are in control.

When an improvable durable good (such as packaged software) saturates the market, the seller could be tempted to release new versions too frequently, hurting her profit. A novel contractual device, which I term as a Free New Version Rights warranty (free NVR warranty), can help the seller overcome this temptation. In a two-period game-theoretic model involving a monopolist firm facing heterogeneous consumers, I derive conditions under which a rational monopolist can act suboptimally: She could face a commitment problem and offer the new version, even if doing so lowers her overall profit. Profit is hurt because when consumers expect a new version, (a) fewer consumers buy the initial version, and (b) the monopolist is forced to charge a lower price for the initial version. I show how the free NVR warranty, which requires the monopolist to offer consumers the right to receive the new version for free for a limited period, can solve her commitment problem. This is a new, surprising finding: By bundling new-version rights with the initial version, the monopolist at first appears to be denying herself future revenue. I derive conditions under which this apparently unprofitable action is optimal, which is my main contribution. When free NVR is offered, consumer surplus decreases and social surplus increases. This work extends prior literature on durable goods and the Coase conjecture to innovative durable goods with network externalities. The findings have important practical implications for firms selling new versions of innovative durable goods subject to network effects, as well as for their consumers.",2-s2.0-38549148788,4,2007,Marketing Science,0

This substitution allows the organization to shift its lower-level hierarchy to the contractors.

By developing the concept of ""gastronationalism,"" this article challenges conceptions of the homogenizing forces of globalism. I analyze (1) the ways in which food production, distribution, and consumption can demarcate and sustain the emotive power of national attachment and (2) how nationalist sentiments, in turn, can shape the production and marketing of food. The multi-methodological analyses reveal how the construct of gastronationalism can help us better understand pan-national tensions in symbolic boundary politics-politics that protect certain foods and industries as representative of national cultural traditions. I first analyze the macro-level dimensions of market protections by examining the European Union's program for origin-designation labels that delineates particular foods as nationally owned. The micro-level, empirical case-the politics surrounding foie gras in France-demonstrates how gastronationalism functions as a protectionist mechanism within lived experience. Foie gras is an especially relevant case because other parties within the pan-national system consider it morally objectionable. Contemporary food politics, beyond the insights it affords into symbolic boundary politics, speaks to several arenas of sociological interest, including markets, identity politics, authenticity and culture, and the complexities of globalization.",2-s2.0-78049445386,7,2010,American Sociological Review,0

This article offers the first direct comparison of the nature and consequences of online and offline social ties, using data collected via a novel network elicitation technique in an experimental setting. We document strong, robust similarity between online and offline relationships.

This article explores the reasons for the unexpected tenacity of share farming and considers its implications for the analysis of rural class structure and agrarian change. Using the example of the resurgence of sharecropping in the California strawberry industry, the paper demonstrates that political constraints on agricultural production are key determinants of the contemporary adoption of sharecropping, establishing a context in which sharecropping not only facilitates but is recreated by capitalist accumulation. -Author",2-s2.0-0021568722,7,1984,American Journal of Sociology,0

The increased priority placed on branding by marketers in recent years offers an opportunity for consumer researchers to provide valuable insights and guidance. In particular, in highly competitive marketplaces, marketers often must link their brands to other entities, for example, people, places, things, or other brands, as a means to improve their brand equity. Understanding this leveraging process requires understanding consumer brand knowledge and how it changes from such associations. In this essay, I identify some promising and productive current research on this topic, and I suggest some important issues for future research.

Recent research suggests that intergenerational relationsthe relationships between adult children and their parents in particularare becoming increasingly important to Americans. Two main social forces appear to be driving these changes: marital instability and broader demographic shifts. Intergenerational relationships involve both affective ties and more instrumental forms of support such as financial resources or child care. Although actual material assistance tends to be episodic and primarily responsive to specific needs, these relationships appear to be durable and flexible and often fill in when marriage or other emotional attachments deteriorate. As such, intergenerational family relations may reflect adaptations to contemporary, postmodern economic and cultural conditions. Variations in these general patterns and dynamics are also exhibited, the most striking of which are those involving race and class. These variations are driven largely by social structure and position and suggest that intergenerational relations constitute an important and largely hidden aspect of how families contribute to the reproduction of social inequality in society. These findings reinforce the value of extending both scholarly and cultural notions of family beyond the traditional nuclear family model.

This paper reports findings from analyses of subnational variations in the extent and timing of the reversal in migration flows between metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas, and the contribution of interdivisional exchanges to the reversal in flows. The more urbanized and industrialized divisions experienced within-state migration flows favoring nonmetropolitan areas as early as the 1935–40 period. Divisions that were highly metropolitan tended to send disproportionate numbers of metropolitan-to-nonmetropolitan migrants to divisions that had low metropolitan concentrations. Findings based on commuting patterns indicate that nonmetropolitan areas adjacent to metropolitan areas are probably residential in character, similar in many respects to suburbs surrounding central cities. These results are consistent with a developmental model of urbanizationimetropolitanization in which the pattern of population redistribution shifts from centralization to deconcentration.",2-s2.0-84962979623,7,1986,Social Forces,0

Horizontal scope - the set of products and services offered - is an important dimension of firm strategy and a potentially significant source of competitive advantage. On one hand, the ability to build close buyer-supplier relationships over multiple transactions can give an advantage to broad firms that offer buyers ""one-stop shopping."" On the other hand, the existence of organizational tradeoffs can give an advantage to firms that specialize in a narrower range of products or services. We develop a biform game that incorporates this tension and show how the use of three generic scope strategies - specialist, generalist, and hybrid - depends on organizational tradeoffs, client-specific scope economies, barriers to entry, heterogeneity in buyer task requirements, and the bargaining power of suppliers relative to buyers. We then use the model to study a variety of issues in supply chain management, including the gains to coordinating suppliers, the optimal level of buyer power, and the desirability of subsidizing suppliers. One of our objectives is to show how biform games, which introduce unstructured negotiations into game theory analysis, can be used to develop applied theory relevant to strategy. Generalizing from our stylized model, we identify a class of biform games involving buyers and suppliers that is useful for strategy analysis. Games in this class have the attractive property of each supplier's share of industry total surplus being the product of its added value and its relative bargaining power.",2-s2.0-34247545617,3,2007,Management Science,0

Exposures of each household within each daypart during each week follow a Poisson process with a distinct rate, which is inferred from the household's past exposure history after accounting for the advertising intensity. Because exposure pattern is computed at the household-level, the model accounts for audience accumulation of dayparts combination, which has a considerable managerial importance in media planning. The model is shown to fit the observed exposure pattern well at both disaggregate and aggregate levels. Applications illustrate the effect of changing the level of GRP on reach and frequency and advertising efficacy of different day-parts.

People sometimes feel the effect of product consumption almost instantaneously-within an unrealistically short time after consumption. Such placebo-like effects are typically attributed to conditioning, motivation, or expectations about product efficacy. The present research shows such effects can also occur because, under some conditions, people are more prone to underestimate the time to onset of products they have used in the past. These recollections of too short a time to onset alter people's experience of products and cause them to report more rapid effects. Participants who were led to believe there was a strong causal link between having consumed a product and improved performance on a task recalled that less time elapsed before they experienced an effect. In subsequent consumption, they felt comfortable using the product later in time, started working on a similar task earlier upon use, experienced the product's effect sooner, and were less inclined to switch to competing products.",2-s2.0-77955674553,4,2010,Journal of Consumer Research,0

Customer impatience has become an integral component of analyzing services, especially in the context of call centers. Typically, when customers arrive to such systems, they seem identical or homogeneous; however, from the system's perspective, as they wait in the queue, their residual willingness to wait changes. For instance, a customer who has already waited for 10 minutes may have a different residual willingness to wait compared with a customer who has only waited for 1 minute. In this manner, as time progresses, customers become differentiated on their estimated patience levels. We exploit this dimension of customer heterogeneity to construct scheduling policies in overloaded systems that dynamically prioritize customers based on their time in queue to optimize any given system performance metric. Interestingly, the optimal policy has a very simple structure, and we find that implementing it can lead to significant improvements over the first-come, first-served policy.",2-s2.0-84978811121,3,2016,Management Science,0

Conventional wisdom holds that behavioral disinhibition has negative effects on what humans do. Behavioral disinhibition may indeed frequently have negative effects, but in the present paper we reveal some positive consequences as well: the disinhibition hypothesis proposed here states that people may feel inhibited to intervene in situations in which non-intervening bystanders are present and that, therefore, behavioral disinhibition may help to overcome the bystander effect. Findings presented here provide evidence supporting this prediction both inside and outside the psychology laboratory: in both real-life and controlled bystander situations, people were more likely and faster to provide help when (unrelated to the bystander situations) they had (vs. had not) been reminded about having acted with no inhibitions. These findings suggest that, in contrast with what various theories and worldviews dictate, behavioral disinhibition may have positive effects on helping behavior and hence can be conducive for the greater good.",2-s2.0-67650708289,6,2009,Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,0

In four laboratory studies, we find that regulatory focus induced by situational cues (such as the framing of an unrelated task) or primed influences people's likelihood to cross ethical boundaries. A promotion focus leads individuals to be more likely to act unethically than a prevention focus (Studies 1, 2, and 3). These higher levels of dishonesty are explained by the influence of a person's induced regulatory focus on his or her behavior toward risk. A promotion focus leads to risk-seeking behaviors, while a prevention focus leads to risk avoidance (Study 3). Through higher levels of dishonesty, promotion focus also results in higher levels of virtuous behavior (Studies 2 and 3), thus providing evidence for compensatory ethics. Our results also demonstrate that the framing of ethics (e.g., through an organization's ethics code) influences individuals' ethical behavior and does so differently depending on an individual's induced regulatory focus (Study 4).",2-s2.0-79956289716,3,2011,Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes,0

One system is concerned with the perceptual control and guidance of actions, the other with the perception and recognition of objects and events. Perceptually controlled actions function in real time and are modularly organized. Infants perceive where they are and what they are doing. By contrast, research on object recognition suggests that even young infants represent some of the defining features and physical constraints that specify the identity and continuity of objects. Different factors contribute to developmental changes within the two systems; it is difficult to generalize from one response system to another; and neither perception, action, nor representation qualifies as ontogenetically privileged.

Online user-generated product reviews have become an indispensible tool for consumers and thus for retailers who want to attract and retain consumers. Yet, relatively little is known about what causes consumers to find an online peer review helpful to their shopping tasks. Prior research examines mostly the effects of product reviews on consumer product attitude, product choice, and product sales. This paper, however, provides an analysis of the determinants of review helpfulness. In two studies, we examine the effects of review characteristics, product type, and reviewer characteristics on perceived review helpfulness. With data collected from a real online retailer, we provide empirical evidence to support our conceptual predictions. Specifically, both review valence and length have positive effects on review helpfulness, but the product type (i.e., experiential vs. utilitarian product) moderates these effects. Using content analysis of reviews, we develop a measure of expressed reviewer innovativeness (i.e., the predisposition toward new products as revealed in review content). A curvilinear relationship exists between expressed reviewer innovativeness and review helpfulness.

The results generally support our hypotheses. First, injustice was the most common cause of sabotage. Second, when the source of injustice was interactional, individuals were more likely to engage in retaliation, and when the source of injustice was distributive, individuals were more likely to engage in equity restoration. Third, the source of injustice and the target of sabotage were generally the same, although this relationship was stronger for organizational targets than for individual targets. Finally, there was an additive effect of distributive, procedural, and interactional justice on the severity of sabotage.

The research quantifies how product development cycle times increase with increased product complexity and with product newness, how using a cross-functional team interacts with product newness in the way it acts to reduce cycle time, and how using a formal product development process interacts with product complexity in the way it acts to decrease cycle time. The findings suggest that using cross-functional teams is more important in projects in which less of the design is a carryover from a previous generation. Teams then had a large impact in reducing product development cycle times. In contrast, implementing a well thought-out process is more important in firms (or divisions of firms) developing complex products or services.

Although some studies have demonstrated in-group bias among children and infants, nothing is known about the underlying motivations of this bias. Using a novel game, we found that in-group love is already present in children of preschool age and can motivate in-group-biased behavior across childhood.

KR is defined as augmented feedback, where the KR is additional to those sources of feedback that are naturally received when a response is made. Transfer tests, usually under no-KR conditions, are essential for unraveling the temporary effects of KR manipulations from their relatively permanent learning effects. When this is considered, the literature reveals findings that produce reasonable agreement, although there are a number of inconsistencies in studies examining the same variables. When learning vs performance effects of KR are separated, a number of contradictions occur; new principles that emerge include the notion that KR acts as guidance, that it is motivating or energizing, and that it has a role in the formation of associations. It is suggested that KR may guide an S to the proper target behavior, with other processes (e.g., simple repetition) being the critical determinants of learning.

Middle class women were likely to have moved from homes that they had owned and lived in for many years. Having strong attachments to place, they coped with relocation by making their new rooms into museums of their lives. Lower class women were likely to have moved many times in their lives and were unlikely to have owned their own homes. Moving into a facility for the elderly was experienced as one in a long succession of moves, distinguished only by increased comfort and security.

Research on political tolerance has made substantial progress in recent years by improving the measures used to gauge public opinion. Much attention has been devoted to developing indicators that control for group affect. Controls for activity affect have not been pursued as vigorously. Indeed, much of the progress has been along the lines of specifying tolerance for unpopular political minorities rather than tolerance for unorthodox or threatening political activities. More generally, tolerance research has not been sensitive to the variety of contextual factors that determine citizen attitudes in civil-liberties disputes. A new approach to measuring political tolerance is presented in this article. The measures developed in this approach disaggregate the traditional measures of tolerance (such as Stouffer's (1955) support for “a communist making a speech in your community”). In particular, scales measuring support for freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, and freedom of political association are presented. As multiple-indicator measures posing conflicts among values, these scales are related to traditional tolerance measures. However, because they reflect the complexity and conflict associated with actual civil-liberties disputes, they will no doubt serve as better predictors of opinions and behaviors in actual disputes.",2-s2.0-84974059087,5,1982,American Political Science Review,0

A fundamental goal of longitudinal modeling is to obtain estimates of model parameters that reflect meaningful aspects of change over time. Often, a linear or nonlinear model may be sensible from a theoretical perspective, yet may have parameters that are difficult to interpret in a way that sheds light on substantive hypotheses. Fortunately, such models may be reparameterized to yield more easily interpretable parameters. This article has 3 goals. First, we provide theoretical background and elaboration on Preacher and Hancock's (2012) 4-step method for reparameterizing growth curve models. Second, we extend this method by providing a user-friendly modification of the structured latent curve model in the third step that enables fitting models that are not estimable with the original method. This modification also allows researchers to specify the mean structure without having to determine which parameters enter nonlinearly and without needing to solve complex matrix expressions. Third, we illustrate how this general reparameterization method allows researchers to treat the average rate of change, half-life, and knot (transition point) as random coefficients; these aspects of change have not before been treated as random coefficients in structural equation modeling. We supply Mplus code for illustrative examples in an online supplement. Our core message is that growth curve models are considerably more flexible than most researchers may suspect. Virtually any parameter can be treated as a random coefficient that varies across individuals.

We find that most African Americans endorse at least half of the components of black nationalism: but reflecting a degree of pragmatism, they give little support to less realistic aspects of black nationalism such as blacks forming a separate nation. Furthermore, the consistency of responses across the components of black nationalism reveals a coherent an structured ideology. Controlling for the effects of age, demographic factors, social identity, and measurement artifacts, a strong black nationalist ideology is associated with greater disaffection toward whites, but not toward gays, black conservatives, lesbians, middle-class blacks, or feminists.

It is shown that the efficiency effect benefits the retailer without affecting the manufacturer, while the strategic effect works to the detriment of the retailer but to the advantage of the manufacturer. Nevertheless, unobservable information acquisition can mitigate the retailer's loss and the manufacturer's benefit from the strategic effect of information disclosure. Moreover, an increasing expected information acquisition cost may benefit the retailer, when that cost is low and information acquisition is unobservable to the manufacturer.

In this article, the authors examine how the stage of product life cycle in which a brand enters affects its sales through brand growth and market response, after controlling for the order-of-entry effect and time in market. The authors develop a dynamic brand sales model in which brand growth and market response parameters vary by stage of life cycle entry, namely, by pioneers, growth-stage entrants, and mature-stage entrants. The authors estimate the model using data on 29 brands from six pharmaceutical markets. The results reveal advantages associated with entering during the growth stage.

They presented three experiments which supposedly showed that, following unexpected and surprising events, judgments were biased in a direction opposite to that predicted by the hindsight bias. We argue that the Mazursky and Ofir results should not be interpreted as a reversal of the hindsight bias for three reasons: (1) Mazursky and Ofir′s supposed reversal effect is on a rating of the quality of a product, rather than on the sort of likelihood ratings on which the hindsight bias has been demonstrated; (2) their results can readily be interpreted in terms of a contrast effect, especially in the case of their Experiments 1 and 2; and (3) given the use of quality ratings, the supposed reversal effect could have resulted from subjects′ desire to rate one product as superior, in part by rating other similar products as inferior.

A theory with evidence from the 101st-108th Congresses. A fundamental tenet of partisan theories of legislative organization is that the majority party is able to generate outcomes that deviate in their preferred direction from the chamber median. While these biased outcomes may be achieved through arm twisting on final passage votes, there is a more efficient means for achieving this bias: restrictive rules. While scholars have recognized this tactic as an important leadership tool in the House, its effectiveness has been often assumed but never empirically tested. We develop a theoretical model that demonstrates how the majority party can use restrictive rules to offer successful ""take-it-or-leave-it"" proposals to the floor median. More significantly, we test this model using DW-NOMINATE's estimated cut points of final passage roll calls in the House from the 101st to 108 th Congress.

We address this question by estimating the exogenous causal effect of gubernatorial influence on the voting behavior of national legislators in Mexico, where constitutional provisions guarantee that the political survival times of governors and legislators are fixed and known ex ante and where we can thus know precisely which legislators will leave congress before their state governor's term has expired. We posit that such legislators will be more willing to represent gubernatorial preferences because they expect the governor to find them employment upon finishing their stay in congress. We find that governors whose terms end after the term of the national assembly are able to systematically increase the voting cohesion of legislators from their own party and state and that these effects are substantively important.",2-s2.0-79958842052,5,2011,Journal of Politics,0

A quantum probability model is introduced and used to explain human probability judgment errors including the conjunction and disjunction fallacies, averaging effects, unpacking effects, and order effects on inference. On the one hand, quantum theory is similar to other categorization and memory models of cognition in that it relies on vector spaces defined by features and similarities between vectors to determine probability judgments. On the other hand, quantum probability theory is a generalization of Bayesian probability theory because it is based on a set of (von Neumann) axioms that relax some of the classic (Kolmogorov) axioms. The quantum model is compared and contrasted with other competing explanations for these judgment errors, including the anchoring and adjustment model for probability judgments. In the quantum model, a new fundamental concept in cognition is advanced-the compatibility versus incompatibility of questions and the effect this can have on the sequential order of judgments.

With the end of the Cold War, the relationship between military and civil technologies is being radically restructured. In the USA, the new paradigm is ‘dual-use’, replacing ‘spinoff’ as the main understanding of the relationship between military and civil technologies. A consequence is the re-integration of the industrial technological base of the military and the civilian sectors, and a complete redefinition of the task of the military industries and their role in technological development. Key concepts here are critical technologies, technology assessment, prototyping and flexible production. In Russia, because of the lack of strong civil actors in the vacuum succeeding the collapse of the Soviet Union, a different development track is emerging. As few examples exist of Western joint ventures, and since conversion is facing both financial and organizational barriers, the conversion problem has been reformulated. The main focus is no longer on conversion of military facilities and know-how for civilian uses. The emerging paradigm implies export of weapons inter alia, to finance conversion. However, such military exports are now justified with reference to commercial concerns. The task is to integrate Russia within the world economy and to gain access to foreign currency.

The conflicting parties must decide whether to send their dispute to the arbitrator, based on their subjective probability beliefs concerning the arbitration’s outcome. If their beliefs are “sufficiently divergent,” we can expect both to agree to arbitration. As similar disputes are arbitrated and precedent is set, however, these divergent beliefs can be expected to vanish. Using some game theoretical results of Aumann and Rosenthal, we demonstrate that such convergence will ruin the incentive to arbitrate for conflicts that are zero (or constant) sum in nature, and for games that are non-constant sum but “best responsive equivalent” to zero sum games. It will not do so in general for conflicts that are non-zero sum. We then examine the welfare implications of these results and point out a paradox that arises in this context.",2-s2.0-84970501229,5,1978,Journal of Conflict Resolution,0

R. M. Roe, J. R. Busemeyer, and J. T. Townsend (2001) have proposed a linear model in which effects previously attributed to loss aversion (A. Tversky & D. Kahneman, 1991) arise from attention switching between attributes and similarity-dependent inhibitory interactions among alternatives. However, there are several reasons to maintain loss aversion in a theory of choice. In view of this, an alternative theory is proposed, integrating loss aversion and attention switching into a nonlinear model (M. Usher & J. L. McClelland, 2001) that relies on inhibition independent of similarity among alternatives. The model accounts for the 3 effects and makes testable predictions contrasting with those of the Roe et al.

Furthermore, we discovered that when employees had positive learning experiences from corporate volunteering, their participation in volunteer programs did not distract from job performance, whereas when employees did not learn much from corporate volunteering, their corporate volunteering harmed job performance at work.

Garfinkel's work over the last five decades has created an alternate view of organizational phenomena which has been understood only at the margins of organization studies. His approach is profoundly empirical yet it is not positivist. He does not deny the reality of things but argues that their appearance as objects on any particular occasion is socially constructed. He shows us familiar organizational things in an unfamiliar way: organized phenomena of order in practical detail. This paper specifically examines the moral dimension of Garfinkel's approach. When Garfinkel says that members make settings accountable, i.e. 'observable and reportable', he means accountable rationally and morally. To explicate this point, the paper examines data from a study of an executive MBA classroom in a way that builds on Macbeth's (2003) ethnomethodological study and examines the way in which the social organization of vernacular talk and interaction in the classroom is simultaneously moral organization. Moral order and social order are shown to be inseparably intertwined in and as the practical details of classroom interaction. Endogenously organized sequences of interaction and vernacular discourse accomplish the emergent socio-moral order of the class; a background texture of relevances which becomes a resource within which members' shared understandings progress.

Reputation systems that rely on voluntary feedback from traders are important in creating and sustaining trust in markets. Feedback nevertheless is a public good, and providing it is often costly. We combine theory with a laboratory experiment to study the effect of a seller precommitment mechanism: Sellers have an option to commit by providing a rebate to reduce the buyer's feedback reporting cost before making purchasing decisions. Our theory predicts that this mechanism induces noncooperative sellers to cooperate in the listed-price market. Using a buyer-seller trust game with a unilateral feedback scheme, we find that the seller's rebate decision has a significant impact on the buyer's purchasing decision via signaling the seller's cooperative type. More importantly, market efficiency under the precommitment mechanism increases with the probability that sellers will provide a rebate. Compared with the no rebate mechanism market, more efficient trades can be achieved when the sellers offer a rebate to the buyers in the market with the rebate mechanism, even when the rebate does not cover the full cost of feedback reporting.

However, whereas normally hearing individuals integrated auditory and tactile information, so that they experienced the audiotactile illusion, individuals who had been temporarily deprived did not.

We argue that political influence improves the business environment for selected firms, but restricts their ability to fire workers. Under these conditions, if political influence primarily lowers fixed costs over variable costs, then favored firms will be less likely to invest and their productivity will suffer, even if they earn higher profits than non-influential firms. We rely on the World Bank's Enterprise Surveys of approximately 8000 firms in 40 developing countries, and control for a number of biases present in the data. We find that influential firms benefit from lower administrative and regulatory barriers (including bribe taxes), greater pricing power, and easier access to credit.

Since technologies are positively correlated across sectors and since aggregate technical change raises aggregate wages, sector technical change is negatively related to early retirement. This is the wage effect. Using individual and sector data, we separate the two effects and find empirical support for the theory.",2-s2.0-79951536616,2,2011,Economic Journal,0

I propose an evolutionary psychological perspective on wars and suggest that the ultimate cause of intergroup conflict may be the relative availability of reproductive women. Polygyny, which allows some men to monopolize all reproductive opportunities and exclude others, may increase the prevalence of civil wars, but not interstate wars, which did not exist in the ancestral environment. The analysis of the Correlates of War data support both hypotheses; polygyny increases civil wars but not interstate wars. Polygyny explains a greater proportion of the variance in civil war experience than democracy does in interstate war experience. If the democratic peace is the first law of international relations (interstate wars), then polygyny may be the first law of intergroup conflict (civil wars).",2-s2.0-67650824972,5,2009,Journal of Politics,0

I construct a quantitative, general equilibrium, overlapping-generations model in which parents and children are linked by accidental and voluntary bequests and by earnings ability. I show that voluntary bequests can explain the emergence of large estates, while accidental bequests alone cannot, and that adding earnings persistence within families increases wealth concentration even more. I also show that the introduction of a bequest motive generates lifetime savings profiles more consistent with the data.",2-s2.0-3843141811,2,2004,Review of Economic Studies,0

The inverse relation between serotonin and human aggression is often portrayed as ""reliable,"" ""strong,"" and ""well established"" despite decades of conflicting reports and widely recognized methodological limitations. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we evaluate the evidence for and against the serotonin deficiency hypothesis of human aggression across 4 methods of assessing serotonin: (a) cerebrospinal fluid levels of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (CSF 5-HIAA), (b) acute tryptophan depletion, (c) pharmacological challenge, and (d) endocrine challenge. Results across 175 independent samples and over 6,500 total participants were heterogeneous, but, in aggregate, revealed a small, inverse correlation between serotonin functioning and aggression, anger, and hostility (r =-12). Pharmacological chal-lenge studies had the largest mean weighted effect size (r =-21), and CSF 5-HIAA studies had the smallest (r =-06). Potential methodological and demographic moderators largely failed to account for variability in study outcomes. Notable exceptions included year of publication (effect sizes tended to diminish with time) and self- versus other-reported aggression (other-reported aggression was positively correlated to serotonin functioning). We discuss 4 possible explanations for the pattern of findings: unreliable measures, ambient correlational noise, an unidentified higher order interaction, and a selective serotonergic effect. Finally, we provide 4 recommendations for bringing much needed clarity to this important area of research: acknowledge contradictory findings and avoid selective reporting practices; focus on improving the reliability and validity of serotonin and aggression measures; test for interactions involving personality and/or environmental moderators; and revise the serotonin deficiency hypothesis to account for serotonins functional complexity.",2-s2.0-84883757098,6,2013,Psychological Bulletin,0

We further explore the role of promotional tools on persistence and drug choice, and we investigate whether physicians who exhibit persistence respond differently to three forms of sales promotion: one-to-one meetings (detailing), out-of-office meetings, and symposium meetings. Our results show significant levels of physician persistence in drug choice. We find that persistence is mostly a cross-sectional physician feature. Nonpersistent physicians appear to be responsive to detailing and symposium meetings, whereas persistent physicians seem to be responsive only to symposium meetings. Out-of-office meetings, such as golf or lunch, have no effect on physicians' drug choice. We also find that (1) older physicians and those who work in smaller practices are more likely to be persistent and (2) physicians who are more willing to receive sales force representatives have a lower likelihood of being persistent.

Unfortunately, these indices present numerous substantive and methodological problems that severely threaten the interpretability and conclusiveness of the obtained results.

Many studies argue that the more direct democratic a system is, the more often voters get what they want, but the empirical evidence is mixed. This analysis explores the democratic effect of initiatives and referendums theoretically and empirically. The prediction of the formal model is that bad representation (i.e., a large preference deviation between the electorate and the political elite) is good for the democratic effect of direct democracy. An empirical investigation of original voter and elite survey data, analyzed with multilevel modeling and poststratification, supports this argument. Building on the literature, the findings of the analysis suggest that the extent to which direct democratic institutions are conducive for policy congruence - and may thus be advisable as democratic correctives to representative systems - depends on the political conflict structure.",2-s2.0-84996606793,5,2016,American Political Science Review,0

When this potential is reduced, either due to age or fatigue, individuals have been observed to report hills steeper and distances longer. Two studies have demonstrated that the experience of an actual reduction in capacities is not necessary. After being primed with the elderly category, young participants estimated the gradient of various pathways and that of a hill steeper (Study 1) and distances across a grassy field longer (Study 2) than their non-primed counterparts. The activation of a social category has often been found to result in stereotype-congruent behaviors.

The most common estimator for SEM is the full-information maximum likelihood (ML) estimator, but there is continuing interest in limited information estimators because of their distributional robustness and their greater resistance to structural specification errors. However, the literature discussing model fit for limited information estimators for latent variable models is sparse compared with that for full-information estimators. We address this shortcoming by providing several specification tests based on the 2SLS estimator for latent variable structural equation models developed by Bollen (1996). We explain how these tests can be used not only to identify a misspecified model but to help diagnose the source of misspecification within a model. We present and discuss results from a Monte Carlo experiment designed to evaluate the finite sample properties of these tests. Our findings suggest that the 2SLS tests successfully identify most misspecified models, even those with modest misspecification, and that they provide researchers with information that can help diagnose the source of misspecification.",2-s2.0-69149103381,7,2009,Sociological Methodology,0

This paper examines populist claims-making in US presidential elections. We define populism as a discursive strategy that juxtaposes the virtuous populace with a corrupt elite and views the former as the sole legitimate source of political power. In contrast to past research, we argue that populism is best operationalized as an attribute of political claims rather than a stable ideological property of political actors. This analytical strategy allows us to systematically measure how the use of populism is affected by a variety of contextual factors. Our empirical case consists of 2,406 speeches given by American presidential candidates between 1952 and 1996, which we code using automated text analysis. Populism is shown to be a common feature of presidential politics among both Democrats and Republicans, but its prevalence varies with candidates' relative positions in the political field. In particular, we demonstrate that the probability of a candidate's reliance on populist claims is directly proportional to his distance from the center of power (in this case, the presidency). This suggests that populism is primarily a strategic tool of political challengers, and particularly those who have legitimate claims to outsider status. By examining temporal changes in populist claims-making on the political left and right, its variation across geographic regions and field positions, and the changing content of populist frames, our paper contributes to the debate on populism in modern democracies, while integrating field theory with the study of institutional politics.",2-s2.0-84975041671,7,2016,Social Forces,0

Yet academic literature provides little clarity about when, for whom, or how larger online retail assortments affect the value of the products. To provide new insights, the current article aims to address ambiguous extant findings about the effects of larger product assortments. Specifically, this research tests whether customers with high, as opposed to low, assessment orientation value products more when they have chosen them from larger, as opposed to smaller, assortments. Four experiments affirm this idea, such that customers with a high assessment orientation value products more when they have chosen them from platforms with relatively larger assortments. Sequential mediation of the effect occurs through increased choice engagement and attitude certainty.

The assumption that immigrant workers incur a disproportionately large number of industrial accidents does not seem to have been based on specific research evidence. Accordingly, a study was carried out of the accident and personnel records of five firms in the West Midlands over a one year period. Overall figures initially appeared to confirm that male immigrant workers had higher accident rates than other workers. However, total factory rates are meaningless because of the lack of control of risk. Thus, the next stage was to compare different ethnic groups doing the same work and with the same degree of risk. But here, immigrants were consistently found to be concentrated in different jobs to indigenous workers, so that in most cases a satisfactory comparison of accident rates was impossible. In the rare instance where there were comparable numbers of different ethnic groups in the same job exhibiting different accident rates, further investigation revealed differences in risk in either the task or the environment. Thus little evidence was found to suggest that cultural background related to industrial accidents. On the contrary, an apparent confirmation of the “accident-prone immigrant” at total factory level is attributable to immigrant workers' over-representation in the more dangerous jobs.",2-s2.0-84965588616,7,1980,Sociology,0

We then show that, even in the absence of any pre-commitment, vertical integration also creates hold-up problems ex post when degrading the quality of the support provided to one downstream firm benefits its rival.We also provide illustrations in terms of standard industrial organization models and of antitrust cases, and discuss the robustness of the insights.",2-s2.0-84962883671,2,2016,Review of Economic Studies,0

Two critiques of D. J. Bem's (1996) ""Exotic Becomes Erotic"" (EBE) theory of sexual orientation are presented. First, the core proposition of EBE theory is considered; that is, the idea that adults are erotically attracted to the gender-based class of peers (males or females) who were dissimilar or unfamiliar to them in childhood. Studies cited by Bem and additional research show that EBE theory is not supported by scientific evidence. Second, Bem's claim that his theory applies equally to both sexes is questioned; instead the argument that it neglects and misrepresents women's experiences is made. Bem's conceptualization of erotic desire and his analysis of gender nonconformity illustrate this problem. It is suggested that different theories may be needed to explain the development of men's and women's sexual orientation.",2-s2.0-0032040295,6,1998,Psychological Review,0

The authors show that failing to attend to attrition rates in online panels has grave consequences. By introducing experimental confounds, unattended attrition misled them to draw mind-boggling yet false conclusions: that recalling a few happy events is considerably more effortful than recalling many happy events, and that imagining applying eyeliner leads to weight loss (Study 2).

When do states attack or consider attacking nuclear infrastructure in nonnuclear weapons states? Despite the importance of this question, relatively little scholarly research has considered when and why countries target nuclear programs. The authors argue that states are likely to attack or consider attacking nuclear facilities when they are highly threatened by a particular country's acquisition of nuclear weapons. Three factors increase the salience of the proliferation threat: (1) prior violent militarized conflict; (2) the presence of a highly autocratic proliferator; and (3) divergent foreign policy interests. The authors test these propositions using statistical analysis and a new data set on all instances when countries have struck or seriously considered striking other states' nuclear infrastructure between 1941 and 2000. The findings lend support for the theory and very little support for the alternative explanations. States are not deterred from attacking nuclear programs by the prospect of a military retaliation and concerns about international condemnation do not appear to influence the willingness to strike. Ultimately, states are willing to accept substantial costs in attacking if they believe that a particular country's acquisition of nuclear weapons poses a significant threat to their security.",2-s2.0-78649595289,5,2010,Journal of Conflict Resolution,0

Innovative capability, the knowledge a firm uses to innovate, is an input into and an output of the process of innovation. In this paper, I put forward the notion that innovative capability, similar to experience in production, accumulates by learning by doing and that innovation is characterized by a learning curve. Using patent data from 20,886 scientists working in 611 biotechnology firms in the U.S. and Canadian biotechnology industry from 1970 to 2007, I estimate a learning curve in innovation and determine the loci of innovative capability. Although knowledge stocks in the different loci accumulate over time in day-to-day firm activities, empirical results suggest that the individual is the primary repository of innovative capability and that experience working together in teams has a secondary influence on productivity. Contrary to prior learning curve research, accumulated firm experience has no direct effect on productivity. However, when individuals possess relevant domain knowledge and have experience working together, they benefit from knowledge spillovers within the firm. This suggests that knowledge stocks in the different loci are complementary to one another and that the comingling of these disparate bins of knowledge is an important facet of innovative capability.",2-s2.0-84888419250,3,2013,Organization Science,0

The statistical description of the formation of marriages is hampered by the fact that the intensity of marriage of one sex depends on the available supply of potential spouses from the other. Unlike the situation that occurs in the study of fertility, there is no reason to give a preference to either of the sexes. To address the fundamental problem caused by the two-sex nature of the process, a solution is proposed that considers the sexes jointly. The solution relies on a novel use of generalized averages. The model is formulated in stochastic terms, and it is parametrized in terms of the overall level of nuptiality, the relative propensity of nuptiality by age, and the mutual relative attraction of spouses at different ages. Although national statistics collection relies on data aggregated by age groups, the models are formulated at individual levels to show how estimation could also be carried out in small populations. In particular, examples of how maximum likelihood estimation can be carried out are given for specific parametric models.

On the one hand, cultural differences in the contemporary world seem to vanish rapidly. This is effected through homogenizing processes of economic and political integration into nation-states and into the global system, as well as the globalization of culture brought about through modern means of mass communication. On the other hand, recent decades have seen the widespread resurgence of ethnic sentiments and the revitalization of local cultural identities. This apparent paradox is here seen as an inherent aspect of modernity. The processes of integration into nation-states puts strong pressures on minorities to assimilate. For this reason, many minority languages are threatened. The article compares the situation of several linguistic minorities, focusing on their relationship with the nation-states to which they are subjected, their strategies of resistance, and problems in challenging linguistic hegemony. Perhaps paradoxically, cultural minorities may have to assimilate culturally in important respects in order to present their case effectively and thereby retain their minority identity. A main conclusion emerging from the comparisons is that states need not be nation-states relying on nationalist ideologies proclaiming the virtues of absolute cultural homogeneity.

The authors suggest that this occurs because consumers have expectations about retail displays and the relationship among displayed brands. Display conditions that disconfirm these expectations can lead consumers to reevaluate the brand. Specifically, the results demonstrate that high-equity brand valuations are influenced by an unfamiliar context brand when (1) a mixed display structure leads consumers to believe that the context brand is diagnostic for judging the high-equity brand, (2) the precedence given to one brand over another in the display makes expectations about brand differences or similarities accessible, and (3) the unfamiliar context brand disconfirms these expectations.",2-s2.0-0033177103,4,1999,Journal of Marketing Research,0

Therefore, the authors conduct a systematic investigation of the business cycle's Impact on the effectiveness of two important marketing instruments: Price and advertising. To do so, they estimate time-varying short- and longterm advertising and price elasticities for 150 brands across 36 consumer packaged goods categories, using 18 years of monthly U.K. data from 1993 to 2010. The long-term price sensitivity tends to decrease during economic expansions, whereas long-term advertising elasticities increase.

Means of resolving the puzzle require modelling the firm interacting with its environment as both a market actor and as an organization, and in particular through the interaction between these two. Such an approach has no need of a separate concept of 'stakeholders'. The analysis develops through the firm's relations with actual and potential political action (raising the separate issue of corporate citizenship), and the tastes of consumers, investors and employees - the last raising interesting implications for principal-agent theory.

Why are negative emotions so central in art reception far beyond tragedy? Revisiting classical aesthetics in light of recent psychological research, we present a novel model to explain this much-discussed (apparent) paradox. We argue that negative emotions are an important resource for the arts in general rather than a special license for exceptional art forms only. The underlying rationale is that negative emotions have been shown to be particularly powerful in securing attention, intense emotional involvement, and high memorability—and hence precisely in what artworks strive for. Two groups of processing mechanisms are identified that conjointly adopt the particular powers of negative emotions for art's purposes. The first group consists of psychological distancing mechanisms that are activated along with the cognitive schemata of art, representation, and fiction. These schemata imply personal safety and control over continuing or discontinuing exposure to artworks, thereby preventing negative emotions from becoming outright incompatible with expectations of enjoyment. This distancing sets the stage for a second group of processing components that allow art recipients to positively embrace the experiencing of negative emotions, thereby rendering art reception more intense, more interesting, more emotionally moving, more profound, and occasionally even more beautiful. These components include compositional interplays of positive and negative emotions, the effects of aesthetic virtues of using the media of (re)presentation (musical sound, words/language, color, shapes) on emotion perception, and meaning-making efforts. Moreover, our Distancing–Embracing model proposes that concomitant mixed emotions often help to integrate negative emotions into altogether pleasurable trajectories.

2803,30259,"Horváth L., Kokoszka P., Rice G.",Testing stationarity of functional time series,"Testing stationarity of functional time series. Economic and financial data often take the form of a collection of curves observed consecutively over time. Examples include, intraday price curves, yield and term structure curves, and intraday volatility curves. Such curves can be viewed as a time series of functions. A fundamental issue that must be addressed, before an attempt is made to statistically model such data, is whether these curves, perhaps suitably transformed, form a stationary functional time series. This paper formalizes the assumption of stationarity in the context of functional time series and proposes several procedures to test the null hypothesis of stationarity. The tests are nontrivial extensions of the broadly used tests in the KPSS family. The properties of the tests under several alternatives, including change-point and I(1), are studied, and new insights, present only in the functional setting are uncovered. The theory is illustrated by a small simulation study and an application to intraday price curves.",2-s2.0-84901348303,2,2014,Journal of Econometrics,0

We develop a framework for continuous search for information on a choice set of multiple alternatives and apply it to consumer search in a product market. When a consumer considers purchasing a product in a product category, the consumer can gather information sequentially on several products. At each moment, the consumer can choose which product to gather more information on and whether to stop gathering information and purchase one of the products or to exit the market with no purchase. Given costly information gathering, consumers end up not gathering complete information on all the products and need to make decisions under imperfect information. Under the assumption of constant informativeness of search, we solve for the optimal search, switch, and purchase or exit behavior in such a setting, which is characterized by an optimal consideration set and a purchase threshold structure. This paper shows that a product is only considered for search or purchase if it has a sufficiently high expected utility. Given multiple products in the consumer's consideration set, the consumer only stops searching for information and purchases a product if the difference between the expected utilities of the top two products is greater than some threshold. Comparative statics show that negative information correlation among products widens the purchase threshold, and so does an increase in the number of the choices. Under our rational consumer model, we show that choice overload can occur when consumers search or evaluate multiple alternatives before making a purchase decision. We also find that it is optimal for a monopolistic seller of multiple products to facilitate information search for low-valuation consumers and obfuscate information for those with high valuations.",2-s2.0-84964321791,3,2016,Management Science,0

Consumer research has shown that satisfaction with complaint handling strongly favours word-of-mouth but affects repurchasing to a lesser extent. To better understand post-complaint consumer response, we propose and test a model in which both gratitude and transactional satisfaction are assumed to be critical mediators of the effects of recovery investments on performance outcomes. Our results show a contrasting pattern of results for each mediator. Whereas gratitude strongly influences repurchase intent but does not explain word-of-mouth intent, transactional satisfaction, with its effect on repurchase intent being fully mediated by the latter construct, strongly contributes to word-of-mouth intent. Drawing on the analysis of pre-existing brand attitude as a moderator, our findings also suggests that the mediating roles of gratitude and satisfaction rely on different psychological mechanisms. The implications of these findings are significant for service recovery researchers and managers.",2-s2.0-84929962952,4,2015,Marketing Letters,0
2806,34986,"Cestone G., Fumagalli C.",The strategic impact of resource flexibility in business groups,"The strategic impact of resource flexibility in business groups. We show that in business groups with efficient internal capital markets, resources may be channelled to either more- or less-profitable units. Depending on the amount of internal resources, a group may exit a market in response to increased competition, or channel funds to the subsidiary operating in that market. This has important implications for the strategic impact of group membership. Affiliation to a monopolistic subsidiary can make a cash-rich (poor) firm more (less) vulnerable to entry deterrence. Also, resource flexibility within a group makes subsidiaries' reaction functions flatter, thus discouraging rivals' strategic commitments when entry is accommodated.

In this article, we argue that states should also consider raising the expected utility of abstaining from terrorism through rewards. We test effects of repressive (or punishing) and conciliatory (or rewarding) actions on terrorist behavior using the newly developed GATE-Israel dataset, which identifies events by Israeli state actors toward Palestinian targets on a full range of counterterrorism tactics and policies from 1987 to 2004. Results show that repressive actions are either unrelated to terror or related to subsequent increases in terror, and conciliatory actions are generally related to decreases in terror, depending on the tactical period.

How can an international organization be made adaptable? Having been designed to fulfil a specific mandate, international organizations should disappear from the world stage once. The initial conditions that led to their establishment no longer exist: their constituents (governments or activists) will not support them when their mandate becomes obsolete or their added value is reduced. Nonetheless, they survive external shocks, resource traps, and even the growing indifference of their founding fathers. The explanation lies in their successful resistance to constituents' control; counter-intuitive adaptation to external change; unplanned expansion through mandate enlargement; and a snowballing albeit unintentional trend to build up networks. Overall, the relative success of international organizations can be measured as a global balance between performance and resilience, exploitation and exploration, autonomy and cooperation. To reach that balanced stage they must be altogether dualistic (coupling the technical with the political); adaptive (converting slack into innovation); organic and ambidextrous (setting new challenges while pursuing current activity). Since they combine components that come from local, national, regional and transnational recipes for survival and performance, they are complex hybrids made up of public agencies, private firms, third sector associations, and expert, activist, or lobbying interest groups.",2-s2.0-84874216350,3,2013,Organization Studies,0

Prior research has shown that experienced pleasure often assimilates to the valence of one's active emotions, such that negative emotions decrease pleasure. In contrast, the authors demonstrate that the activation of guilt, a negative emotion, enhances the pleasure experienced from hedonic consumption. The authors show that this effect occurs because of a cognitive association between guilt and pleasure, such that activating guilt can automatically activate cognitions related to pleasure. Furthermore, the authors show that this pattern of results is unique to guilt and cannot be explained by a contrast effect that generalizes to other negative emotions.

We propose a new strategy for a pervasive problem in the hedonics literature: recovering hedonic prices in the presence of time-varying correlated unobservables.

Comparisons with other national surveys indicate that underreporting of use of illicit drugs other than marijuana appears to have taken place, and that light users of these drugs are underrepresented among the self-acknowledged users. Comparison with marijuana use reported four years earlier indicates that experimental marijuana users are much less likely than extensive users to acknowledge involvement. Even after controlling for frequency of use, underreporting is more common among terminal high school dropouts and minorities. Not only individual characteristics but field conditions also contribute to underreporting. Familiarity with the interviewer, as measured by number of prior interviewing contacts, depresses drug use reporting.

Using data on environmental activism targeting U.S. firms between 2004 and 2008, we examine variation in the effectiveness of secondary and primary stakeholder activism in shaping perceptions about environmental risk.

While anger and hostility are found to be correlated with hypertension, the mechanism is not yet clearly specified. A global portrait drawn from the literature would depict the hypertensive as a conflicted individual ridden with hostility and resentment, constantly guarding against impulse expression through distancing, suppression, submission, and/or compliance. In the heart disease literature, aggression is more commonly referred to than anger; recent evidence suggests, however, that hostility may be a highly significant component of the Type A coronary-prone behavior pattern. In contrast to hypertensives, coronary-prone individuals seem to be more aggressive, prone to channel emotional arousal into action, and less anxious when provoked.

Foreign aid, whether distributed directly (bilateral aid) or indirectly through multilateral institutions such as the MDBs, is one of several tools through which the USA furthers its human rights policy. Several studies show the conflicted human rights policies the USA pursues with bilateral aid, but very few examine the role of human rights in US multilateral aid policy. It is this deficit that the present study addresses by examining what factors determine how the USA votes on proposals before the Executive Board in the various MDBs. Using a multinomial logistic regression model I test whether US votes in the MDBs are conditioned on recipient countries' respect for human rights along with other strategic interest variables. The study finds that respect for political rights has an important role in determining US votes in the MDBs although much of the impact is accounted for by votes specifically against China. Conversely, respect for rights of personal integrity do not have an impact on US voting. Level of economic development and whether the country receives military aid from the USA are also important determinants of US votes, as well as the level of trade between the USA and the recipient country.",2-s2.0-84904306889,5,2014,Journal of Peace Research,0

It is concluded that even limiting the analysis to the national attributes of size, wealth, and type of political system provides as much explanation for national support for world order as participation in international organizations, and in some cases accounts for variation in support for world order that cannot be accounted for by participation in international organizations. Implications of these results are then broadened to other studies which use the nation-state as the unit of analysis.",2-s2.0-84965565176,5,1978,Journal of Conflict Resolution,0
2837,62412,Kaufmann K.M.,"Culture wars, secular realignment, and the gender gap in party identification","Culture wars, secular realignment, and the gender gap in party identification. Changes in the U.S. partisan balance over the past decade are often attributed to the enhanced political salience of cultural issues. Yet as white men have continued to become more Republican in recent years, white women increasingly identify with the Democrats. To the extent that cultural issues are influencing this partisan change, men and women must be responding differently to this cultural agenda. Using a pooled ANES data set from 1988 through 2000, I explore the extent to which cultural values are responsible for this gender realignment. Findings suggest that salient cultural issues influence the partisan choices of both men and women, however in somewhat different ways. For women, the issues themselves - reproductive rights, female equality, and legal protection for homosexuals - have become increasingly important determinants of party identification. For men, the influence of cultural conflict on partisanship is argued to be equally pervasive, albeit less direct.",2-s2.0-0036957139,5,2002,Political Behavior,0

Using insights from the organizational ecology literature-namely that competition occurs within ""species""-I create a variable that assesses intraspecies competition. I test both claims using a data set of domestic terrorism created from the Global Terrorism Database (GTD) for the years 1970 to 1997. I find support for the hypothesis that competition leads to more terrorism, validating the claims of outbidding theorists. Furthermore, ideologies have differential effects on whether outbidding occurs, with nationalist and religious terrorist groups responding to competition with more terrorism and left-wing organizations responding with less.",2-s2.0-84898918971,5,2014,Journal of Conflict Resolution,0

The general decrease in telephone survey response rates leads to potential selection and estimation biases. As nonrespondents can be broken down into noncontacts and refusals, different strategies can be deployed - increasing the number of call attempts before abandoning a number, and calling back refusals/abandonments to persuade them to participate. Using a two-stage random-digit-dialing sample of 8,645 individuals aged 15-49 for a survey on sexual and reproductive health (SRH), we compared the effects of the two strategies: including hard-to-contact respondents (more than twenty call attempts with no upper limit) and including respondents from two successive waves of call-back among initial refusals/abandonments. Comparisons were based on sociodemographic bias, differences in SRH behaviors, multivariate logistic modeling of SRH behaviors, post-calibration weighting, and cost estimation. The sociodemographic profile of hard-to-contact and call-back respondents differed from that of easy-to-interview respondents. Including hard-to-contact respondents decreased the socio- demographic bias of the sample, while including call-back respondents increased it. Several significant differences in SRH behaviors emerged between easy-to-interview and hard-to-contact respondents, but none between first-wave and call-back respondents. Nevertheless, the determinants of SRH behaviors in call-back and hard-to-contact respondents differed with respect to easy-to-interview respondents. The trade-off between bias and financial costs suggests that the best protocol would be to mix the two strategies but with only one call-back wave involving a limited number of call attempts to achieve a sufficient sample size with optimal quality.",2-s2.0-84886618295,5,2013,Public Opinion Quarterly,0

In a classic theory, Durkheim (1912) predicted that because of the social sharing of emotion they generate, collective gatherings bring participants to a stage of collective effervescence in which they experience a sense of union with others and a feeling of empowerment accompanied by positive affect. This would lead them to leave the collective situation with a renewed sense of confidence in life and in social institutions. A century after Durkheim's predictions of these effects, though, they remained untested as a whole. This article reports 4 studies, 2 correlational, 1 semilongitudinal, and 1 experimental, assessing the positive effects of participation in either positively valenced (folkloric marches) or negatively valenced (protest demonstrations) collective gatherings. Results confirmed that collective gatherings consistently strengthened collective identity, identity fusion, and social integration, as well as enhancing personal and collective self-esteem and efficacy, positive affect, and positive social beliefs among participants. In line with a central tenet of the theory, emotional communion, or perceived emotional synchrony with others mediated these effects. Higher perceived emotional synchrony was associated with stronger emotional reactions, stronger social support, and higher endorsement of social beliefs and values. Participation in symbolic collective gatherings also particularly reinforced identity fusion when perceived emotional synchrony was high. The respective contributions of perceived emotional synchrony and flow, or optimal experience, were also assessed. Whereas perceived emotional synchrony emerged as strongly related to the various social outcomes, flow was observed to be related first to collective efficacy and self-esteem, and thus, to encompass mainly empowerment effects.",2-s2.0-84928557797,6,2015,Journal of Personality and Social Psychology,0

Hellman's (1998) depiction of the Partial Reform Equilibrium (PRE) presented a prophecy of despair for many transition economies. Because winners from initial economic reforms could use their newfound power to block further reform initiatives that might undermine their lucrative positions, escaping the PRE trap required the simultaneous resolution of two conundrums. Policymakers interested in furthering transition needed to both overcome opposition from the concentrated group of early winners and unite a disparate group of potential beneficiaries from future reforms into an alternative coalition. In this article, I rigorously test the theory that Vietnamese reformers managed to solve both dilemmas and to escape their unique partial reform trap through the targeted creation of new provinces in 1996. The tactic provided reformers with a majority of votes in the Central Committee, allowing them to push through a series of economic initiatives directly at odds with the State Owned Enterprise Sector, Vietnam's early winners.",2-s2.0-67650805387,5,2009,Journal of Politics,0

Information about event probability upon which decisions depend may be more or less precise.

Participants had to rank order sets of six lotteries according to attractiveness. While the lotteries' values were always precisely known precision of information about lottery chances varied. These experiments showed that increasing ambiguity tied decisions closer to lottery values. The second section shows that modeling participants' decisions with the contingent weighting model suggests that this outcome prominence effect was not necessarily caused by any change in the respective weighting of probability and outcome information, but that it had probably occurred for purely mathematical reasons. The third part of this paper explores, by means of a computer simulation, (i) which weighting strategy is optimal when probabilities are imprecise and (ii) how participants' decision behavior compared to a simple, but better adapted strategy. It shows that the weighting of probability information should not change with decreasing precision and it implies that participants' performance suffered most from a lack of strategic consequence.

In addition, Whites' biases against strongly identified minorities dissipated when strongly identified minorities expressed strong endorsement of status-legitimizing worldviews.

Several other theories, however, propose different relationships between economic inequality and nationalism. This article provides a first empirical test of whether and how economic inequality is related to nationalism. Multilevel analyses using survey data on nationalist sentiments in countries around the world over a quarter century and data on economic inequality from the Standardized World Income Inequality Database provide powerful support for the diversionary theory of nationalism.

In Experiment 3, priming the goal of being fast increased driving speed and errors for participants who had formed mere goal intentions to drive only as fast as safety allowed or who had formed no goal intentions, whereas the driving of participants who had formed such goal intentions as well as implementation intentions showed no such priming effects.

The temporary introduction of a minimum wage leads to a rise in subjects' reservation wages which persists even after the minimum wage has been removed. Firms are therefore forced to pay higher wages after the removal of the minimum wage than before its introduction. As a consequence, the employment effects of removing the minimum wage are significantly smaller than are the effects of its introduction. The impact of minimum wages on reservation wages may also explain the anomalously low utilization of subminimum wages if employers are given the opportunity to pay less than a minimum wage previously introduced. It may further explain why employers often increase workers' wages after an increase in the minimum wage by an amount exceeding that necessary for compliance with the higher minimum.

I find that the effects of intervention on postwar QOL depend on its type, unilateral intervention, and United Nations (UN) intervention. Unilateral interveners seeking self-interest tend to impede the improvement in postwar QOL particularly in terms of life expectancy and infant mortality rate. They are likely to do so through producing their protégé’s military victory or negotiated settlement, expanding their influence on postwar government, and resultingly forming a government less responsive to citizens’ hardship and reducing resources available for welfare. UN intervention on humanitarian grounds tends to promote postwar social development particularly in the fields of public health, although it has no significant effect on literacy rate.

In three studies, clinically depressed participants were more likely than nondepressed participants to use emotion-regulation strategies in a direction that was likely to maintain or increase their level of sadness. This pattern was found when using the regulation strategies of situation selection (Studies 1 and 2) and cognitive reappraisal (Study 3).

While it is universally recognized that states are responsible for human rights conditions in their jurisdictions, it is less often noticed that this responsibility has two dimensions, one normative and one empirical. Normatively, most people agree that states ought to prevent human rights abuses. Empirically, however, states may not always be able to do so. In weak and failing states, agency loss and the inability to police effectively can lead to abuses by private individuals and rogue agents of the state. Thus, on balance, weak states typically have worse human rights records than strong ones. This is demonstrated by a global time-series cross-section analysis showing that indicators of state weakness - low tax revenues, corruption, and lack of law and order - all have a negative impact on human rights to personal security. The effect differs for different kinds of rights. Extrajudicial killings are highly sensitive to state capacity, while political imprisonment is more sensitive to democracy. Overall, however, it appears that the totalitarian model of human rights abuse by excessively strong states applies to a restricted set of cases. The more common problem is states that cannot effectively protect human rights.

This study explores logical and empirical implications of friendship and enmity in world politics by linking indirect international relations (e.g., ""the enemy of my enemy"" ""the enemy of my friend"") to direct relations (""my friend,"" ""my enemy""). The realist paradigm suggests that states ally against common enemies and thus states sharing common enemies should not fight each other. Nor are states expected to ally with enemies of their allies or with allies of their enemies. Employing social network methodology to measure direct and indirect relations, we find that international interactions over the last 186 years exhibit significant relational imbalances: states that share the same enemies and allies are disproportionately likely to be both allies and enemies at the same time. Our explanation of the causes and consequences of relational imbalances for international conflict/cooperation combines ideas from the realist and the liberal paradigms. ""Realist"" factors such as the presence of strategic rivalry, opportunism and exploitative tendencies, capability parity, and contiguity increase the likelihood of relational imbalances. On the other hand, factors consistent with the liberal paradigm (e.g., joint democracy, economic interdependence, shared IGO membership) tend to reduce relational imbalances.

Considerable research indicates that decision makers exhibit risk avoiding or risk taking behavior depending upon whether options are viewed as gains or losses with respect to a given reference point. We argue in this paper that multiple points of reference are important determinants of risky behavior in many decision contexts, and that research should explicitly consider their effect to fully understand and predict risky behavior. The analysis of contextual features is extended to consider the impact of prior gains and losses in the second part of the paper. Seventy-two professional corporate managers participated in two experiments that involved a corporate investment decision setting. The setting exemplifies a context that has both multiple important points of reference and prior gains and losses. The data indicated that the presence of multiple relevant reference points results in a complex pattern of risky behavior, where managers′ decisions to accept or avoid risk were affected by the relative positions of risky alternatives with respect to two important points of reference. In particular, a mixture of risk taking and risk avoiding occurred for options between the relevant reference points. The managers were also found to be more willing to accept risk after experiencing a prior gain as opposed to a prior loss.

But a second discourse of marketing, found in the frontstage, uses survey data to divide the market into ""blue-collar"" and ""jazz"" types. By structuring marketing strategy to attract the former and repel the latter, managers exclude black consumers and euphemize such exclusion vis-à-vis the state and other public audiences. Findings extend not only racial formation theory, but also U.S.-based understandings of discrimination.",2-s2.0-77951032261,7,2010,Social Problems,0

Bundle promotions - the practice of granting consumers a discount when they buy a certain number of units from a designated range of stockkeeping units - have gained popularity among manufacturers and retailers. In this research, the authors investigate the purchase effects of bundle promotions for a category of packaged goods. Contrary to intuition, they find that promotional bundles are far more effective at inducing switching than at boosting category sales. The strong switching effects result from two mechanisms: (1) Stockkeeping units that are part of a bundle promotion appear to reinforce each other's choice probability, and (2) the bundle discount tends to attract consumers even if they do not buy enough to qualify for the price reduction. The weak category effects follow from the notion that the purchase quantity requirement is often too stringent to make consumers buy earlier and/or more in the category. The authors develop incidence, quantity, and choice models that incorporate the intricate bundle mechanisms, and they use simulations to contrast the sales impact of bundle and traditional per-unit promotions. On the basis of the model estimates, they present managerial implications and tentative guidelines for optimal bundle design.",2-s2.0-36349035479,4,2007,Journal of Marketing Research,0

To understand the rise of market fundamentalism from the margins of influence to mainstream hegemony, we compare the U.S. 1996 Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunities Reconciliation Act and the English 1834 New Poor Law - two episodes in which existing welfare regimes were overturned by market-driven ones. Despite dramatic differences across the cases, both outcomes were mobilized by ""the perversity thesis"" - a public discourse that reassigned blame for the poor's condition from ""poverty to perversity."" We use the term ""ideational embeddedness"" to characterize the power of such ideas to shape, structure, and change market regimes. The success of the perversity thesis is based on the foundations of social naturalism, theoretical realism, and the conversion narrative. In the poverty to perversity conversion narrative, structural blame for poverty is discredited as empiricist appearance while the real problem is attributed to the corrosive effects of welfare's perverse incentives on poor people themselves - they become sexually promiscuous, thrust aside personal responsibility, and develop long-term dependency. This claim enables market fundamentalism to delegitimate existing ideational regimes, to survive disconfirming data, and to change the terms of debate from social problems to the timeless forces of nature and biology. Coupling economic sociology with a sociology of ideas, we argue that ideas count; but not all ideas are created equal. Only some have the capacity to fuel radical transformations in the ideational embeddedness of markets.",2-s2.0-20844458957,7,2005,American Sociological Review,0

When is a social actor most strongly influenced by its peers? This article addresses this question by clarifying when computer firms were most strongly affected by the choices of their structurally equivalent rivals to adopt a well-known technology: Intel's sixth-generation processor. The core hypothesis is that the effect of adoptions by structurally equivalent firms increases with the competitive pressure that a focal firm faces in its market position. The results show that a chosen firm is most strongly influenced by comparable others when it faces scale-based competition and is diversified. The implications of this study are twofold: a social actor's sensitivity to the conduct of others may depend not only on its place in a hierarchy but also on the nature of its ties to an external audience; and a contingent theory of social influence may be necessary to characterize diffusion processes correctly, particularly when external and time-varying nonnetwork factors have significant effects.",2-s2.0-0344287173,7,2003,American Journal of Sociology,0

Compared to judgment, choice is argued to elicit more self-referent processing and thereby produce greater subsequent recall of evaluated information. This response mode effect is shown to be dependent upon sufficient visualization to overcome the use of heuristic processing during choice. When visualizing prior to the task, choice leads to increased thinking about personal consumption occasions relative to judgment, leading to enhanced recall of vivid (vs. non-vivid) attributes. This proposed interaction of task and visualization was found in two experiments that assessed incidental recall following a choice or judgment task. In experiment 1, participants recalled more vivid product attribute information after choosing between options than after rating each option separately, but only when instructed to visualize during evaluation. To eliminate a comparison-based explanation of this effect, a second experiment was conducted that presented only one option in each category. Participants who evaluated their intention to purchase the option (a judgment equivalent of choice) demonstrated greater recall of vivid product attribute information than did participants who rated their liking for the option, and this recall difference was again moderated by instructions to visualize.",2-s2.0-27744442349,3,2005,Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes,0

This paper demonstrates that a competitive market allocation of operating licenses, whether attained through auctioning, selling, or allowing resale of the rights, does not, in general, assure efficiency. The profit criterion that would guide the allocation of licenses in a competitive market would not necessarily lead to the uses that maximize social benefits. The paper shows that the difference between private and social incentives in the allocation process can be quite large.

Consistent with the ""decision maker"" model, they find that shifts in aggregate support for the war have a greater impact on presidential approval than do equivalent shifts in perceptions of war success or approval of the president's handling of the war.

This article explores some characteristics of international governmental organizations (IGOs) and their development.

Furthermore, stratification has increased most notably within economic and military IGOs, while the opposite is case among socio-cultural and coordinative organizations. These trends might indicate the increasing significance of the ‘bargaining model’ of interna tional relations, especially in economic matters between developed and developing countries. Thus far, the realization of this structural model has not been possible for one simple reason: there is no collective organization strong enough in the Third World, so Great Powers have been able to apply a ‘one-at-time’ - policy in organizational interaction with developing coun tries. A typology of international organizations based on the ranks of member states is presented. This typology, for example, indicates that low total and high average rank of member states leads to a higher probability of organizational agreement upon great sectoral scope and high range in decision making.",2-s2.0-84970724434,5,1970,Journal of Peace Research,0

The growing sophistication of component technologies and the rising costs and uncertainties of developing and launching new products require firms to collaborate in the development of new products. However, the management of new product development that occurs jointly between firms presents a new set of challenges in sharing the costs and benefits of innovation. Although collaboration enables each firm to focus on what it does best, it also introduces new issues associated with the alignment of decisions and incentives that have to be managed alongside conventional performance and timing uncertainties of new product development. In this paper, we conceptualize and formulate the joint development of products involving two firms with differing development capabilities and examine the implications of arrangements that go beyond sharing of revenues to include sharing of development cost and work. We term these approaches that involve sharing of the development cost and sharing of the development work investment sharing and innovation sharing, respectively. These cost and effort sharing mechanisms have subtle interactions with the degree to which revenues are shared between firms and the type of development project under consideration. Our analysis shows that investment and innovation sharing are particularly relevant for products with no preexisting revenues, and their benefits also depend on the degree to which revenues are shared between the firms. Whereas investment sharing is more attractive for new-to-the-world product projects with significant timing uncertainty, innovation sharing plays an important role in environments where projects experience product quality uncertainty, firms are similar in their capabilities, and the costs of integration of work across firms can be controlled. Our key contribution involves the modeling of joint work and decision making between collaborating firms and unearthing the complementary role of revenue, cost, and innovative effort sharing mechanisms for new product development.

Accounts provided in a survey of 250 individuals who knew people who had died in the UK are examined. The analysis counters the view that the denial of death is widespread in conditions where religion no longer offers individuals a meaningful narrative for the dying self. Scripts for proclaiming heroic self-identity in the face of death are promoted by cultural experts and appropriated by many lay individuals. This involves a struggle against external and internal enemies to gain knowledge, the opportunity to demonstrate courage and a beatific state of emotional accompaniment in which 'carers' and dying people participate. Unlike more traditional forms of heroism, this script deviates from celebrating solely masculine qualities and includes a female heroics of care, concern and emotional expression. At the same time, some deaths cannot be written into this script, which is particularly well suited to deaths from cancer and AIDs. The deaths of the very old, the mentally confused and sudden unexpected deaths are often difficult to interpret in these heroic terms. Additionally, a rival script exists amongst some lay individuals that stands in opposition to the professional consensus on the desirability of open awareness. This emphasises the benefits of continuing the everyday project of the self oblivious of oncoming death, with others shouldering the burden of awareness in an attempt to protect the dying person against the strain of knowledge. This rival script, however, commands decreasing allegiance in a society where the project of the self is rarely given over to the care of others, and trust is commonly negotiated in confessional moments.",2-s2.0-84965520993,7,1995,Sociology,0

Empathy is often thought to occur automatically. Yet, empathy frequently breaks down when it is difficult or distressing to relate to people in need, suggesting that empathy is often not felt reflexively. Indeed, the United States as a whole is said to be displaying an empathy deficit. When and why does empathy break down, and what predicts whether people will exert effort to experience empathy in challenging contexts? Across 7 studies, we found that people who held a malleable mindset about empathy (believing empathy can be developed) expended greater empathic effort in challenging contexts than did people who held a fixed theory (believing empathy cannot be developed). Specifically, a malleable theory of empathy-whether measured or experimentally induced-promoted (a) more selfreported effort to feel empathy when it is challenging (Study 1); (b) more empathically effortful responses to a person with conflicting views on personally important sociopolitical issues (Studies 2-4); (c) more time spent listening to the emotional personal story of a racial outgroup member (Study 5); and (d) greater willingness to help cancer patients in effortful, face-to-face ways (Study 6). Study 7 revealed a possible reason for this greater empathic effort in challenging contexts: a stronger interest in improving one's empathy. Together, these data suggest that people's mindsets powerfully affect whether they exert effort to empathize when it is needed most, and these data may represent a point of leverage in increasing empathic behaviors on a broad scale.",2-s2.0-84911025123,6,2014,Journal of Personality and Social Psychology,0

Research indicates that people's intuitive beliefs about groups are organized according to a group typology (B. Lickel, D. L. Hamilton, & S. J. Sherman, 2001). In Study 1, the authors compared and contrasted people's spontaneous cognitive representations of two group types, task groups and social categories. Analyses revealed significant differences as well as commonalties in people's beliefs about the group types. Notably, perceivers used more abstract, enduring language and contextually rich descriptors when characterizing social categories than when describing task groups. In Study 2, the authors investigated the differential roles of distinct group perception variables (entitativity, homogeneity, essence, role differentiation, and agency) as predictors of stereotyping for the different group types. Entitativity and all of the group perception variables significantly predicted stereotyping for both social categories and task groups. However, perceptions of entitativity mediated the association between the group perception variables and stereotypic judgments. These findings demonstrate that laypeople hold stereotype-like mental representations of group types other than social categories and that entitativity plays a crucial mediating role in stereotyping across different types of groups.

Notably, individuals who endorse this form of collective punishment tend not to hold the target of retaliation to be morally responsible. In other words, the psychological mechanisms underlying such ""vicarious"" forms of collective punishment appear to be distinct from the evaluation of moral responsibility.

We jointly estimate the two models using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods with a unique panel data set of 1,979 mergers between 4,444 firms across industries and countries from 1992 to 2008. We find that similarity in national culture and technical knowledge has a positive effect on partner selection and post-merger innovation. Anticipated synergy from subindustry similarity, however, is not realized in post-merger innovation. Furthermore, some key synergy sources are unanticipated when selecting a merger partner. For example, financial synergy from higher total assets and complementarity in total assets and debt leverage as well as knowledge synergy from breadth and depth of knowledge positively influence innovation but not partner selection. Furthermore, factors that dilute synergy (e.g., higher debt levels) are unanticipated, and firms merge with firms that detract from their innovation potential.

This research demonstrates that consumers' willingness to pay for the product after the promotion is retracted is higher when it was offered for free than when it was offered at a low, discounted price. The underlying reasoning is that the price of the product on promotion is used as a natural anchor for value estimation. However, when the product is offered for free (i.e., zero price), consumers are less likely to consider the value of the product and are influenced by anchors such as the price of the focal purchase.

In exploring the impact of economic problems on public opinion, scholarship has nearly exclusively focused on personal and national economic experiences. At present, little to no research analyzes the impact of economic distress within one's social network on an individual's attitudes. Drawing upon network and contact theories, it is argued that financial hardship experienced vicariously through one's friends should influence an individual's views about the political economy, and ultimately, their economic policy preferences, such as support for redistribution. Utilizing national survey data, this article demonstrates that having economically distressed friends heightens perceived class-based bias in the political system - namely, that the rich have undue influence over politics. Further, moderated regression analysis reveals that this effect depends upon the prevalence of political discussion within one's friendship network. Finally, mediation analysis reveals that, by heightening perceived class-based bias, distress within one's friendship network indirectly increases support for government efforts to redress inequality.",2-s2.0-84891778672,5,2014,Journal of Politics,0

When monopoly power in the capital market is applied to the disadvantage of borrowers, less oil is initially made available to oil importers than if the interest rate had been competitively determined. This depletion bias, however, is reversed if, because of incentives for capital accumulation, it is to the advantage of the oil producers to subsidize lending to the oil importers.

This concluding article in the special issue of Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes on the foundations of knowledge transfer in organizations argues that the creation and transfer of knowledge are a basis for competitive advantage in firms. The article builds on a framework of knowledge reservoirs to show why knowledge transfer can be difficult and to identify the kinds of knowledge that are most difficult to transfer to different contexts. The article develops the proposition that interactions among people, tasks, and tools are least likely to fit the new context and hence are the most difficult to transfer. This theoretical result illuminates how organizations can derive competitive advantage by transferring knowledge internally while preventing its external transfer to competitors. Because people are more similar within than between organizations, interactions involving people transfer more readily within than between firms. By embedding knowledge in interactions involving people, organizations can both effect knowledge transfer internally and impede knowledge transfer externally. Thus, knowledge embedded in the interactions of people, tools, and tasks provides a basis for competitive advantage in firms.",2-s2.0-0002443925,3,2000,Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes,0

Although it is reasonable to expect self-compassion to benefit relationships by promoting self-esteem, it is also reasonable to expect self-compassion to hurt relationships by removing intimates' motivation to correct their interpersonal mistakes. Two correlational studies, 1 experiment, and 1 longitudinal study demonstrated that whether self-compassion helps or hurts relationships depends on the presence versus absence of dispositional sources of the motivation to correct interpersonal mistakes. Among men, the implications of self-compassion were moderated by conscientiousness. Among men high in conscientiousness, self-compassion was associated with greater motivation to correct interpersonal mistakes (Studies 1 and 3), observations of more constructive problem-solving behaviors (Study 2), reports of more accommodation (Study 3), and fewer declines in marital satisfaction that were mediated by decreases in interpersonal problem severity (Study 4); among men low in conscientiousness, self-compassion was associated with these outcomes in the opposite direction. Among women, in contrast, likely because women are inherently more motivated than men to preserve their relationships for cultural and/or biological reasons, self-compassion was never harmful to the relationship. Instead, women's self-compassion was positively associated with the motivation to correct their interpersonal mistakes (Study 1) and changes in relationship satisfaction (Study 4), regardless of conscientiousness. Accordingly, theoretical descriptions of the implications of self-promoting thoughts for relationships may be most complete to the extent that they consider the presence versus absence of other sources of the motivation to correct interpersonal mistakes.",2-s2.0-79955505321,6,2011,Journal of Personality and Social Psychology,0

There is a high degree of cross validation between coding methods, including computer coding. This implies that it is indeed possible to use computer-coded content analysis to derive reliable and valid estimates of policy positions from political texts.

Does the type of regime really make no difference to the likelihood of violent conflict over basic issues of stateness such as separatism and decolonization? Can democratic peace theory be successfully applied when dealing with the national identity or stateness question? This article extends the application of the democratic peace to the process of decolonization. It examines conflict between imperial states and their colonies during the process of decolonization and investigates the question of whether democracy affects the likelihood of conflict. The central finding is that, contrary to the implications of some prominent theories of state formation and democracy, democratic imperial states are significantly less likely to go to war with their colonial possessions in the process of achieving independence. Further, the authors find only a monadic, not dyadic, democratic peace effect. The regime type of the colony does not have a significant effect on the likelihood of war. It is the nature of the regime of imperial states, rather than that of colonies, that is a significant factor. In addition, the predominant source of this effect appears to be the institutional constraints placed on executive action within democracies, rather than the influence of mass politics or the effects of political competition. Regarding power-related factors, power parity between sovereign and colony makes conflict more likely (a colonial power-transition effect), but imperial decline actually makes war with colonies less likely. Sensitivity analysis reveals that a number of other hypothesized effects cannot find robust support. Simulations are used to assess the magnitude of the effect of regime type pre- and post-independence.

This research fills a gap in the retailing literature regarding the impact of shoppers' perceptions of being watched while shopping for embarrassing products. Four studies consistently show that an employee watching a shopper can cause the shopper to either permanently or temporarily leave the shopping area as purchase intentions decrease. Reactance theory explains this relationship, which is mediated by consumers' feelings of control over their own privacy. Essentially, when shoppers believe an employee is watching them, they feel less in control of their privacy, resulting in negative consequences for the retailer. This relationship is especially important for products that consumers may already feel some level of embarrassment over purchasing in the first place. The results have important theoretical implications for reactance theory by demonstrating that a consumer can regain control even when the original threat to behavior still exists. Additionally, increasing options that allow a consumer to regain control will reduce the overall reactance to the threat to privacy and will improve retailer outcomes. Practitioner recommendations present several techniques that allow the consumer to regain privacy control in spite of the sometimes necessary practice of watching in-store consumers.",2-s2.0-85019368728,4,2017,Journal of Retailing,0

Although a substantial body of literature suggests a positive relationship between decision process rationality and organizational performance, there is also compelling evidence that this relationship is negative. We argue that these equivocal findings may be due, in part, to a lack of construct specificity and different methodologies employed to assess decision process rationality. Drawing from Langley's (1989) framework of decision process rationality, we examined the effects of formal analysis for purposes of information, persuasion and communication, control and direction, and symbolism, considering also their effects in the context of environmental dynamism. Using survey data from top management teams in 42 organizations, we found that in both high and low dynamism environments, the instrumental use of information in decision processes was positively linked with organizational performance. In dynamic environments, while analyses for symbolic and control purposes were positively associated with performance, analysis for persuasion was negatively associated with performance. By unraveling the performance effects of different elements of decision-making rationality, we can better understand the nature of relationships between strategic decision processes and organizational performance. This understanding might ultimately lead to better strategic decision making in organizations. Copyright",2-s2.0-34249088621,3,2007,Organization Studies,0

This study incorporates parent and peer relationship measures from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health to examine (1) whether parents treat more physically developed daughters differently than their less developed peers, and (2) whether more developed girls are located in friendship networks that are more conducive to delinquency than the networks of less developed girls. Earlier pubertal development and more advanced development are associated with three types of delinquency: ""party"" deviance, minor delinquency, and serious delinquency. The strength of the association is strongest for ""party"" deviance (e.g., drinking, smoking, truancy, disorderly conduct). Conflict with parents, trust and autonomy from parents, exposure to peer deviance, and involvement in romantic relationships mediate the puberty-delinquency association. However, the relative importance of each of these mechanisms varies by the context of delinquency and the indicators of pubertal development that are used.",2-s2.0-0141907282,7,2003,Social Forces,0

It is suggested that a concern with the indefiniteness of human descriptive resources is an important point of convergence between the work of Garfinkel and Wittgenstein. It is further argued that, whilst this indefiniteness is not usually a source of practical descriptive difficulty, the supposition of such indefiniteness is a condition for the theoretical treatment of conflicting descriptions, the flexibility of human descriptive resources and their novel applicability together with related problems concerning personal, cultural, and linguistic change, cultural and linguistic relativism etc. which would be unintelligible from the standpoint of a finite rule-based semantic and interactional theory.

Yet, the effectiveness of this policy on work-to-family interference is mixed, thus requiring additional investigation. We address this gap by applying multilevel data pairing the 2005 International Social Survey Programme (ISSP) for individuals in 32 nations (N = 20,937) with country-level measures of legislated weekly work hours, mean reported weekly work hours (aggregated and differentiated by gender), and individualistic/collectivist orientations. We find that legislated work hours have no impact on individuals' reports of work-to-family interference. By contrast, shorter normative weekly work hours, aggregated and by gender, are associated with greater individual work-to-family interference. We find an equivalent pattern in individualistic countries. While we document individual-level gender and parental differences, we find no differential effects of long workweeks for these groups. We explain these associations through the heightened expectations perspective, arguing that increased resources heighten expectations of work-life balance and sensitivity to work-to-family interference.",2-s2.0-85015701821,7,2016,Social Forces,0

In this paper, we show that slotting fees can be part of an equilibrium solution if per-unit downstream margin is smaller than the per-unit upstream margin. In recent literature, a similar margin-based argument is made by Klein and Wright (2007), whereas intense downstream retail competition coupled with high upstream margin causes upstream manufacturers to offer slotting fees for promotional shelf space. In this paper, we generalize this argument and show that it is possible to have the margin-based argument without any downstream retail competition and competition between products within a retail chain. Interestingly we show that slotting fees will be larger if the products sold by a retailer are complements rather than substitutes. Using a model of a channel bargaining game, we also provide the necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of slotting fees and show that for contracts with slotting fees under full vertical coordination, upstream marginal cost functions need to be increasing. Broadly, our findings provide new insights into the strategic role of downstream product assortment on equilibrium-marketing-channel contracts with slotting fees.",2-s2.0-84890940666,3,2013,Management Science,0

To test this assumption, an exploratory study with a national sample of the Israeli-Jewish population and two subsequent experimental studies were conducted.

We develop a structural model to examine user demand for voice service and SMS. Specifically, we measure the own- and cross-price elasticities of these services. The cross-price elasticity is of significant importance because marketing activities are critically influenced by whether the goods are substitutes or complements. The research context poses significant econometric challenges due to three-part tariffs and sequential discrete plan choice and continuous quantity choice decisions. Using detailed individual consumption data of more than 6, 000 customers, we find that SMS and voice service are small substitutes. A 10% increase in the price of voice minutes will induce about a 0.8% increase in the demand for SMS. The own-price elasticity of voice is also low, to the order of approximately -0.1. Younger users' demand is far more inelastic than that of older users.

This paper analyzes the competitive role of retail shopping experience in markets with consumer search costs. We examine how a retailer's advantage in providing consumer shopping experience affects its equilibrium pricing and price advertising strategies. We find that if the consumer valuation of a shopping experience is sufficiently low, its effect on retailer strategy is similar to that of quality, and the retailer with the advantage in shopping experience then deploys higher levels of price advertising. On the other hand, when the shopping experience is valuable enough for consumers, it acts akin to price advertising in that it makes it optimal for the retailer with the advantage in shopping experience to eschew price advertising. The optimal competitive investments in consumer shopping experience can be higher than that of a monopoly. The profit impact of shopping experience for a retailer depends on the level of shopping experience: for low levels, the profit impact depends on the difference in the levels between the retailers, but for high enough levels, it depends only on whether the retailer's shopping experience level is higher than that of its competitor. In this case, even small differences in shopping experience levels can result in large differences in equilibrium profits.",2-s2.0-84871210678,4,2012,Marketing Science,0

These ""framing"" effects were found for an ill-structured problem with multiple causes and a wide range of viable options. These findings extend previous research on problem solving and decision making under uncertainty which has used different types of tasks and not focused on option generation per se. In addition, they extend previous research on option generation, which has not examined the effect of causal focus on option generation or selection. Additional analyses suggest that the option generation process can be represented as a cycle of option generation, clarification, and evaluation against certain criteria specified by the frame, with periodic breaks for considering data and to a lesser extent, the causes of it. The selected options tended to be those that had been evaluated, clarified, and generated again (i.e., regenerated) more often during the course of the option generation process. To use an analogy, the causal focus pointed the option generation rifle; option evaluation, clarification, and generation pulled the trigger.",2-s2.0-0012262387,3,1995,Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes,0

I propose a simple hidden action model where the agent has implicit incentives to avoid bankruptcy. After signing the contract, but before acting, the agent observes a signal on future luck. Implicit incentives are weaker after good news, and call for higher pay-for-performance sensitivity in good times. As a result, managerial pay is tied to luck. The model is also consistent with recent evidence of asymmetric pay for luck, that is, a larger exposure of managerial pay to good luck than to bad.",2-s2.0-79957745832,2,2011,RAND Journal of Economics,0
2974,48837,Inman J.J.,The role of sensory-specific satiety in attribute-level variety seeking,"The role of sensory-specific satiety in attribute-level variety seeking. The variety seeking theoretical paradigm offers little guidance regarding the attributes of a stimulus that are most likely to drive the desire to switch. We review 25 years of research in physiobehavior, arguing that it can be extended in a natural way to predict that consumers are more likely to switch between sensory attributes (e.g., flavor) than nonsensory attributes (e.g., brand). Specifically, we examine the work on sensory-specific satiety, a term used to describe the phenomenon whereby the pleasantness of a food just eaten drops significantly while the pleasantness of uneaten foods remains unchanged. These findings lead to the thesis explored in this research that consumers are more likely to seek variety on sensory attributes, which is then tested across three studies comparing flavor switching to brand switching. Study 1 uses ACNielsen wand panel data for purchases of tortilla chips and cake mixes from almost 2,000 consumers over a three-year period. Study 2 examines actual consumption behavior using a six-week consumption diary panel from over 850 consumers in two cities. Heterogeneity across the samples in terms of the observed effects is examined in both studies. Study 3 employs a survey methodology to ascertain whether the differential role of flavor-based versus brand-based variety seeking is mediated by factors other than sensory-specific satiety. The findings strongly support the relevance of sensory-specific satiety to attribute-level variety seeking. Across the three studies, consumers switched more intensively on flavor than brand in 14 of the 15 categories examined and other factors such as preference heterogeneity and perceived risk fail to explain this difference.",2-s2.0-0035540381,4,2001,Journal of Consumer Research,0

An accurate television viewing choice model is an important tool for television executives and advertisers. The authors present a new viewing choice model, which differs from the traditional Rust-Alpert model in three ways: (1) It introduces a new show characteristic - the demographic characteristics of a show's cast; (2) it allows the preferences over the traditional show categories to be a function of both observable and unobservable individual characteristics; and (3) it allows the cost of switching among the viewing alternatives to vary across show types and individual characteristics. Cross-validated predictive testing shows that this model fits the data better than the Rust-Alpert model does. Furthermore, the authors demonstrate that network executives can improve ratings by using this model.

Existing literature suggests that the increasing concentration in the retail industry is allowing powerful retailers to exploit their weaker suppliers, which causes the suppliers' performance to suffer. This study takes a collaborative perspective of resource dependency theory and suggests that when suppliers engage in supply chain relationships with key retail account (KRA) customers, their performance may improve, depending on the varying levels of the supplier's and KRAs' market shares. The empirical analysis of data from two large retailers, Wal-Mart and Target, and a broad cross-section of their suppliers provides ample support for most of the hypotheses set forth in this paper: Suppliers that depend on KRAs for a significant share of their total revenues relinquish some of their leverage in the marketplace, but as the KRAs gain market share, their suppliers' performance tends to increase. Cumulatively, these results provide evidence of collaborative supplier-KRA relationships, such that a supplier's dependency on KRAs may positively affect supplier performance. This finding supports a more positive, symbiotic view of dependency, resulting in important implications for key account management, supply chain management, and retail research and practice.",2-s2.0-84865420946,4,2012,Journal of Retailing,0

Using data from a novel laboratory experiment on complex problem solving in which we varied the structure of 16-person networks, we investigate how an organization's network structure shapes the performance of problem-solving tasks. Problem solving, we argue, involves both exploration for information and exploration for solutions. Our results show that network clustering has opposite effects for these two important and complementary forms of exploration. Dense clustering encourages members of a network to generate more diverse information but discourages them from generating diverse theories; that is, clustering promotes exploration in information space but decreases exploration in solution space. Previous research, generally focusing on only one of those two spaces at a time, has produced an inconsistent understanding of the value of network clustering. By adopting an experimental platform on which information was measured separately from solutions, we bring disparate results under a single theoretical roof and clarify the effects of network clustering on problemsolving behavior and performance. The finding both provides a sharper tool for structuring organizations for knowledge work and reveals challenges inherent in manipulating network structure to enhance performance, as the communicationstructure that helps one determinant of successful problem solving may harm the other.",2-s2.0-84997343329,3,2015,Organization Science,0

A key research issue is whether neglect is exhibited with respect to the left side of the viewer or of objects. When deficits in attentional allocation depend not merely on an object's location with respect to the viewer but on the object's intrinsic extent, shape, or movement, researchers have inferred that attention must be operating in an object-based frame of reference. Simulations of a view-based connectionist model of spatial attention prove that this inference is not logically necessary: Object-based attentional effects can be obtained without object-based frames.

My arguments amplify an important insight of the classical theorists: No assumption of individual differences is necessary to explain the emergence of social differentiation. Computer simulations show that simple assumptions about interaction patterns, communication, the social construction of knowledge, and forgetting imply that originally undifferentiated social systems will become differentiated over time. The simulations show that system size negatively affects cultural homogeneity and positively affects social differentiation. Memory, or the capacity of individuals to store information, is determined by the information technologies individuals have at their disposal. Memory positively affects cultural homogeneity and negatively affects social differentiation. Memory also positively affects the size of integrated social systems such as organizations and societies.

There have been numerous attempts to explain the enigma of autism, but existing neurocognitive theories often provide merely a refined description of 1 cluster of symptoms. Here we argue that deficits in executive functioning, theory of mind, and central coherence can all be understood as the consequence of a core deficit in the flexibility with which people with autism spectrum disorder can process violations to their expectations. More formally we argue that the human mind processes information by making and testing predictions and that the errors resulting from violations to these predictions are given a uniform, inflexibly high weight in autism spectrum disorder. The complex, fluctuating nature of regularities in the world and the stochastic and noisy biological system through which people experience it require that, in the real world, people not only learn from their errors but also need to (meta-)learn to sometimes ignore errors. Especially when situations (e.g., social) or stimuli (e.g., faces) become too complex or dynamic, people need to tolerate a certain degree of error in order to develop a more abstract level of representation. Starting from an inability to flexibly process prediction errors, a number of seemingly core deficits become logically secondary symptoms. Moreover, an insistence on sameness or the acting out of stereotyped and repetitive behaviors can be understood as attempts to provide a reassuring sense of predictive success in a world otherwise filled with error.",2-s2.0-84921949880,6,2014,Psychological Review,0

We consider sealed- and open-bid total-cost procurement auctions where two attributes are used for contract award decisions: price, which is bid by the supplier, and a fixed cost adjustment, which is included by the buyer to capture nonprice factors such as logistics costs. Suppliers know only their own true production cost and their own cost adjustment, and the buyer does not know the suppliers' true production costs but does know all suppliers' cost adjustments, which she herself sets in order to make an informed total-cost decision. The buyer, who seeks to minimize her total (price and cost adjustment) procurement cost, can choose to run a first-price sealed-bid auction, where suppliers' bids are affected by their beliefs about each other's total costs, or a descending open-bid auction, where only the actual realizations of suppliers' total costs drive the auction outcome. We characterize the buyer's choice between the two formats as a threshold decision over suppliers' cost adjustments and analyze the effect of supplier beliefs on her decision. We also study the impact of additional suppliers on the buyer's decision, the effect of correlation between suppliers' production costs and their cost adjustments, and additive as well as multiplicative total-cost functions.

Data were from 448 employees of a U.S. manufacturing firm. As expected, citizenship was more strongly and negatively related to perceived victimization for whites as compared to African-Americans.

We examine the supply side factors likely to influence older married and cohabiting women's employment participation, comparing the importance of their own 'human capital' (in terms of age, health, occupational class and qualifications) and the characteristics of their household (husbands' employment, class and earnings, the presence of children and tenure). For women in their forties, household circumstances had a greater effect than human capital, but in their fifties women's own attributes were the major influence on employment participation. Financial necessity was a major reason why mid-life women remained in employment. For women in their fifties, increasing age had a residual effect in reducing employment participation after all other factors considered had been controlled.",2-s2.0-84937298113,7,1995,Sociology,0

3007,43031,Raelin J.A.,A Model of Work-Based Learning,"A Model of Work-Based Learning. A comprehensive model of work-based learning is illustrated combining explicit and tacit forms of knowing and theory and practice modes of learning at both individual and collective levels. The model is designed to bring together epistemic contributions which are typically studied in isolation. The learning types produced from the model represent processes the intersection of which can contribute to the development of a comprehensive theory for integrating learning and work. At the individual level, work-based learning might start with conceptualization which provides practitioners with a means to challenge the assumptions underlying their practice. In experimentation, they engage their conceptual knowledge in such a way that it becomes contextualized or grounded. However, within the world of practice, in applying theoretical criteria or advanced analytical techniques, one confronts technical, cultural, moral, and personal idiosyncrasies which defy categorization. Hence, experience is required to reinforce the tacit knowledge acquired in experimentation. In fact, learning acquired through experience, often referred to as implicit learning, is the foundation for tacit knowledge and can be used to solve problems as well as make reasonable decisions about novel situations. Nevertheless, reflection is required to bring the inherent tacit knowledge of experience to the surface. It thus contributes to the reconstruction of meaning. At the collective level, conceptualization again makes a contribution in informing spontaneous inquiry but is now embedded within the more formal methods of applied science. Scientists seek to describe and explain social reality through the manipulation of theoretical propositions using the rules of hypothetico-deductive logic. The theories of applied science are often not helpful to practitioners, however, unless they are incorporated into practice. This is the purview of action learning wherein real-time experience, especially problems occurring within one's own work setting, constitutes the primary subject matter. As practitioners come together by being involved with one another in action, they may become a community of practice wherein they learn to construct shared understanding amidst confusing and conflicting data. Hence, community of practice returns knowledge back into its context such that groups learn to observe and experiment with their own collective tacit processes in action. Action science is called upon to bring the individuals' and group's mental models, often untested and unexamined, into consciousness. It is a form of ""rellection-in-action"" which attempts to discover how what one did contributed to an unexpected or expected outcome, taking into account the interplay between theory and practice. Applications of the model can spur conceptual and practical developments that might lead to a comprehensive theory of work-based learning. The discussion takes up such issues as transition links between learning types, their segmentation by function or process, and implications for epistemology. A sample program, incorporating many of the learning types in the model, is demonstrated. The paper argues that all eight types of learning need to be brought into consideration if learners are to achieve proficiency and become critical while learning at work.",2-s2.0-1542633801,3,1997,Organization Science,0

The new specification test compares the difference of the forward (conventional) 2SLS estimator of the coefficient of the right-hand side endogenous variable with the reverse 2SLS estimator of the same unknown parameter when the normalization is changed. Under the null hypothesis that conventional first order asymptotics provide a reliable guide to inference, the two estimates should be very similar. Our test sees whether the resulting difference in the two estimates satisfies the results of second order asymptotic theory. Essentially the same idea is applied to develop another new specification test using second-order unbiased estimators of the type first proposed by Nagar. If the forward and reverse Nagar-type estimators are not significantly different we recommend estimation by LIML, which we demonstrate is the optimal linear combination of the Nagar-type estimators (to second order). We also demonstrate the high degree of similarity for k-class estimators between the approach of Bekker and the Edgeworth expansion approach of Rothenberg.

The principle of ""Divide and Conquer"" (DAC) suggests that: (1) complex decision problems should be decomposed into smaller, more manageable parts and (2) these smaller parts should be logically aggregated to derive an overall value for each alternative. Typically, decompositional procedures have been compared to holistic evaluations that require decision makers to simultaneously consider all of the relevant attributes in the evaluation of the objects under consideration. These comparisons between decompositional and holistic judgments have primarily used a variant of Multiattribute Utility Theory (MAUT). We presented a general experimental framework that allows for a more extensive assessment of the DAC principle, as well as the effects of decision complexity on both holistic and decompositional procedures. We illustrate this approach with a study that uses the Simple Multiattribute Rating Technique with Swing Weights (SMARTS; Edwards & Barron, 1994) and the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP; Saaty, 1980). We report data comparing the convergent validity (e.g the agreement between decompositional and holistic strategies) and the temporal stability for decompositional and holistic judgments on a variety of dependent measures. Decision complexity did not significantly affect the correspondence between decompositional and holistic judgments for both SMARTS and AHP judgments.

Previous work shows that, as the buyer's uncertainty about the quality of some good or service increases, so does the tendency to purchase that good or service via embedded transactions, rather than from strangers. While this previous work explains variation in embedded exchange across different types of purchases, it does not address variation in embedded exchange across persons. Our research integrates the embeddedness and trust literatures to explain variation in within-network exchanges based on an interaction of the purchaser's generalized trust and the level of uncertainty entailed in the purchase (i.e., whether there exists an incentive for the seller to misrepresent the quality of some good or service). For purchases involving uncertainty, low-trusters will tend to forgo risky transactions with strangers, opting instead for the increased certainty of embedded markets. High-trusters, on the other hand, will be more likely to transact with strangers (despite the increased risk), from whom they can often find better deals. We should not expect any differences between high- and low-trusters for products that do not entail uncertainty.

I highlight a key determinant of recruiter tactics, namely, the tension between personnel needs and infiltration risks. Drawing on signalling theory, I present an analytical framework that conceptualizes recruitment as a trust game between recruiter and recruit. I argue that the central logic shaping recruiter tactics is the search for cost-discriminating signs of trustworthiness. Due to the context-specificity of signal costs and the room for tactical innovation, optimal recruitment tactics vary in space and time, but the underlying logic is the same for most groups facing a high threat of infiltration. I apply the framework to an al-Qaeda recruitment campaign in early 2000s Saudi Arabia, where it helps explain tactical preferences (why recruiters favoured some recruitment arenas over others) and differential network activation (why recruiters preferred war veterans over radical candidates from other networks). The trust dilemma also accounts for unexpected recruiter choices, such as their reluctance to solicit on the Internet and in mosques, and their preference for recruits who knew poetry or wept during prayer.

The fundamental reason that mutual optimism cannot lead to war is that if both sides are willing to fight, each side should infer that they have either underestimated the strength of the opponent or overestimated their own strength.

Nonlinear price responses by shoppers in brand choice decisions have important managerial and theoretical implications for designing pricing and price promotions. However, the study of these phenomena by traditional parametric techniques is not only tedious, but may lead to an incorrect confirmation of theory. To avoid these problems I demonstrate a simplified means for detecting the possible presence of nonlinearities in consumer response by means of a unique, nonparametric method. This method relaxes the usual linear-in-parameters character of the multinomial logit (MNL) model by an additive sum of one-dimensional nonparametric functions of explanatory variables. In an application of this model to aseptic and red drink databases, I document the presence of these nonlinearities in the form of price threshold effects and a saturation effect with respect to price reductions. I further apply the model to orange juice and ground coffee scanner data by employing the framework of a previous parametric study by Kalyanaram and Little (1994). The model easily found the expected existence of weak price sensitivity around the reference price and a greater consumer negative reaction to price increases than positive reactions to price decreases.

Teaching and research in social administration have been dominated by the study of the public social services. Some of the limitations of this approach have been exposed by the perpetuation and growth of inequality in welfare state societies. Existing conceptions of social policy do not provide an adequate framework for the study of the social production and exploitation of inequality. The tendency to equate social policy with the institutionalized welfare state has reinforced the insular tendencies in British social administration, overemphasized the importance of government in the distribution of resources and fostered a false image of the benevolent state as the embodiment of welfare principles. Alternative definitions of social policy are needed to ensure that the analysis of welfare is more comprehensive than that carried out so far within the framework of social administration. It is argued that the essential aspect of social policies are their distributional implications or outcomes. Social policies may be made implicitly or explicitly, by a wide range of social institutions and groups, including the state. The task of social policy analysis is to evaluate the distributional impact of existing policies and proposals and the rationales underlying them. In such analyses attention will be focussed less on the problems of individuals or clients, than on the behaviour of organizations, professions and classes in order to balance descriptions of the institutional framework through which the welfare state is administered with analysis of the social production and maintenance of inequality.

Numerous studies have noted the lack of change in the sexual division of housework, despite substantial change in factors believed to affect it. According to popular thought, men are at best making selective inroads, such that change is limited to the more enjoyable work. This paper explores how combined educational attainment levels of spouses affect the division of housework, taking into account the relative 'pleasantness' of particular tasks. For this purpose 1992/93 Dutch data are used, including a national survey on the enjoyment of routine housework. Our findings stress the relevance of discriminating between different sorts of tasks. Firstly, men, if they contribute, do so more to the preferred tasks of shopping or cooking than to the less enjoyed cleaning or laundry. Generational differences suggest, however, that change towards equalisation permeates all tasks alike. Secondly, the division of each type of housework varies between couples with different educational compositions. The effects of education are such that an explanation based on egalitarian values fares better than one based on human capital. Finally, comparing the spouses, the results indicate that the influence of wives' education dominates. However, among highly educated wives this does not hold true when it comes to cleaning.",2-s2.0-0033229617,7,1999,Sociology,0

We argue that political advertising is rife with both informational and emotional content and actually contributes to a more informed, more engaged, and more participatory citizenry. With detailed advertising data from the 2000 election, we show that exposure to campaign advertising produces citizens who are more interested in the election, have more to say about the candidates, are more familiar with who is running, and ultimately are more likely to vote. Importantly, these effects are concentrated among those citizens who need it most: those with the lowest pre-existing levels of political information.",2-s2.0-8344275815,5,2004,American Journal of Political Science,0

The pursuit of social rank is a recurrent and pervasive challenge faced by individuals in all human societies. Yet, the precise means through which individuals compete for social standing remains unclear. In 2 studies, we investigated the impact of 2 fundamental strategies-Dominance (the use of force and intimidation to induce fear) and Prestige (the sharing of expertise or know-how to gain respect)-on the attainment of social rank, which we conceptualized as the acquisition of (a) perceived influence over others (Study 1), (b) actual influence over others' behaviors (Study 1), and (c) others' visual attention (Study 2). Study 1 examined the process of hierarchy formation among a group of previously unacquainted individuals, who provided round-robin judgments of each other after completing a group task. Results indicated that the adoption of either a Dominance or Prestige strategy promoted perceptions of greater influence, by both group members and outside observers, and higher levels of actual influence, based on a behavioral measure. These effects were not driven by popularity; in fact, those who adopted a Prestige strategy were viewed as likable, whereas those who adopted a Dominance strategy were not well liked. In Study 2, participants viewed brief video clips of group interactions from Study 1 while their gaze was monitored with an eye tracker. Dominant and Prestigious targets each received greater visual attention than targets low on either dimension. Together, these findings demonstrate that Dominance and Prestige are distinct yet viable strategies for ascending the social hierarchy, consistent with evolutionary theory.",2-s2.0-84875551174,6,2013,Journal of Personality and Social Psychology,0

Australian employees comprising 230 females and 401 males with partners and/or children and 208 female and male childless singles were surveyed three times over three years. Employees who had greater personal agency and less family barriers were more willing to expatriate, to search for international jobs, and to eventually leave their home countries. Having a family restricted females' ability to transform their willingness to expatriate into an international job search to a greater extent than it did males'. In turn, international job search predicted actual expatriation for a job. Overall, the expatriation interests of women with partners and/or children were least realized (most inhibited) in international job search and subsequent expatriation behavior. The interests of childless single employees were most realized. The study challenges current thinking on women's willingness to expatriate by demonstrating that women are willing to expatriate, but family factors lead to women being less able to transform their willingness into an international job search than men, subsequently flowing on to women expatriating less for work than men.",2-s2.0-39749145798,3,2008,Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes,0

Recent work on the psychology of gender has emphasized comparisons of men and women. Such comparisons rest on a view of gender as an individual difference or psychological attribute. Feminist theorists have challenged this view as limited and inadequate. In place of it, a variety of alternative conceptions of gender are emerging. These conceptions shift the focus of analysis from the indivual to interpersonal and institutional arenas. Moreover, they dispute the idea of gender as static, unitary, and separable from other markers of social identity and status. In contrast to Alice Eagly (1995), I assert that the production of knowledge (whether by scientific procedures or other means) is not set apart from society, but rather is always and inevitably embedded within it.

Whereas present-hedonistic individuals overstate their intentions, present-fatalistic individuals understate theirs, so both types exhibit low intention-behavior consistency. Future time-oriented individuals instead exhibit high intention-behavior consistency because they are less likely to overstate their intentions. The findings are contributed to decision makers' time perspective influencing the construal of distant-future behavior when reporting behavioral intentions.

3048,78806,"Monroe S.M., Harkness K.L.",Recurrence in Major Depression: A Conceptual Analysis,"Recurrence in Major Depression: A Conceptual Analysis. Theory and research on major depression have increasingly assumed a recurrent and chronic disease model. Yet not all people who become depressed suffer recurrences, suggesting that depression is also an acute, time-limited condition. However, few if any risk indicators are available to forecast which of the initially depressed will or will not recur. This prognostic impasse may be a result of problems in conceptualizing the nature of recurrence in depression. In the current paper we first provide a conceptual analysis of the assumptions and theoretical systems that presently structure thinking on recurrence. This analysis reveals key concerns that have distorted views about the long-term course of depression. Second, as a consequence of these theoretical problems we suggest that investigative attention has been biased toward recurrent forms of depression and away from acute, time-limited conditions. Third, an analysis of how these theoretical problems have influenced research practices reveals that an essential comparison group has been omitted from research on recurrence: people with a single lifetime episode of depression. We suggest that this startling omission may explain why so few predictors of recurrence have as yet been found. Finally, we examine the reasons for this oversight, document the validity of depression as an acute, time-limited disorder, and provide suggestions for future research with the goal of discovering early risk indicators for recurrent depression.",2-s2.0-80755155787,6,2011,Psychological Review,0
3049,49545,"Sungho P., Gupta S.",Simulated maximum likelihood estimator for the random coefficient logit model using aggregate data,"Simulated maximum likelihood estimator for the random coefficient logit model using aggregate data. The authors propose a simulated maximum likelihood estimation method for the random coefficient logit model using aggregate data, accounting for heterogeneity and endogeneity. The method allows for two sources of randomness in observed market shares: unobserved product characteristics and sampling error. Because of the latter, the method is suitable when sample sizes underlying the shares are finite. In contrast, Berry, Levinsohn and Pakes's commonly used approach assumes that observed shares have no sampling error. The method can be viewed as a generalization of Villas-Boas and Winer's approach and is closely related to Petrin and Train's ""control function"" approach. The authors show that the proposed method provides unbiased and efficient estimates of demand parameters. They also obtain endogeneity test statistics as a by-product, including the direction of endogeneity bias. The model can be extended to incorporate Markov regime-switching dynamics in parameters and is open to other extensions based on maximum likelihood. The benefits of the proposed approach are achieved by assuming normality of the unobserved demand attributes, an assumption that imposes constraints on the types of pricing behaviors that are accommodated. However, the authors find in simulations that demand estimates are fairly robust to violations of these assumptions.",2-s2.0-69549117134,4,2009,Journal of Marketing Research,0

However, the origins of these capacity limitations are debated, and generally attributed to active, attentional processes. Here, we show that the existence of interference among items in memory mathematically guarantees fixed and limited capacity limits under very general conditions, irrespective of any processing assumptions. Assuming that interference (a) increases with the number of interfering items and (b) brings memory performance to chance levels for large numbers of interfering items, capacity limits are a simple function of the relative influence of memorization and interference. In contrast, we show that time-based memory limitations do not lead to fixed memory capacity limitations that are independent of the timing properties of an experiment. We show that interference can mimic both slot-like and continuous resource-like memory limitations, suggesting that these types of memory performance might not be as different as commonly believed. We speculate that slot-like WM limitations might arise from crowding-like phenomena in memory when participants have to retrieve items. Further, based on earlier research on parallel attention and enumeration, we suggest that crowding-like phenomena might be a common reason for the 3 major cognitive capacity limitations. As suggested by Miller (1956) and Cowan (2001), these capacity limitations might arise because of a common reason, even though they likely rely on distinct processes.

Changes in agent's perceptions of these constraints will in general produce changes in the schedules that describe the choices they make as a function of the information that they possess. Until very recently, received dynamic econometric practice ignored this principle. The practice of dynamic econometrices should be changed to be consistent with the principle that people's rules of choice are influenced by their constraints.

This paper analyzes one type of temporary organization, film projects, exploring the way in which roles both organize immediate work and maintain continuity across different projects. On each film set, role expectations are communicated through practices of enthusiastic thanking, polite admonishing, and role-oriented joking, which enable crew members to learn and negotiate role structures. Two important structural characteristics of film projects provide the organizational context within which coordination takes place: interorganizational career progression and projects as temporary total institutions. By showing how these structural elements and role enactments support one another, this work generates a more complete understanding of the conditions that affect coordination, including role duration, expectations of future interaction, and visibility of work.",2-s2.0-33644595202,3,2006,Organization Science,0

The single-suspect model allows for the occurrence of foil identifications, a known-error category, whereas the all-suspect model does not. A Bayesian analysis of posterior probabilities of the guilt of a given suspect under various prior probabilities shows that the all-suspect model may be more or less diagnostic than the single-suspect model depending on the extent to which the use of suspects rather than foils increases the prior likelihood that the actual target is in the lineup. On the other hand, the lineup-wise error rate (which is the likelihood that any suspect will be falsely identified) is considerably higher with the all-suspect lineup. Field data show that the all-suspect lineup is sometimes used by police departments, and some data suggest that police do not appreciate the distinction between the two models with regard to lineup-wise error rates.

People believe that they observe others more than do other people and that they are generally observed less than are others (Studies 1-3, 5, 6). The illusion persists both among strangers in the same vicinity (Study 2) and among friends interacting with one another (Study 3), and it cannot be explained away as yet another general better-than-average bias nor is it the result of believing one has more thoughts, in general, than do other people (Studies 2-3). The illusion is supported by a failure to catch others watching oneself (Studies 1b, 4) and it is manifest in the specific contents of people's thoughts about one another (Studies 5 and 6). Finally, rendering a feature of one's appearance salient to oneself fails to interrupt the illusion despite increasing one's belief that others are paying more attention specifically to that salient feature (Study 6).",2-s2.0-85006511588,6,2017,Journal of Personality and Social Psychology,0

New products are often incongruent with consumer expectations. Researchers have shown that consumers prefer moderately incongruent products, while being adverse to extremely incongruent products. Evidence from three studies suggests that this phenomenon is highly influenced by a consumer’s state of arousal. Specifically, low arousal decreases preference for moderate incongruity while increasing preference for extreme incongruity, whereas high arousal decreases preference for any form of incongruity. Underlying these effects are discrete emotional states brought on by a physiological response to incongruity. Varying arousal subsequently varies the severity of the emotion, be it negative (anxiety) or positive (curiosity), which in turn varies evaluations for the product. This suggests that creating excitement around a product launch may be good for incremental innovation, but it may not be a good idea for something truly innovative.",2-s2.0-84928238162,4,2014,Journal of Consumer Research,0

Our analysis reveals that these networked organizations differed as a function of their approach to four complexity management activities: perspective shifting, shaping interactions, managing standards and constructing commitment. Based on the use of these four activities we identify three approaches to complexity management in this study – leveraging complexity, suppressing complexity and disengaging from complexity. Each of these approaches differed in their focus on differentiation or integration in the implementation of complexity management activities. We found that only leveraging complexity went beyond separate management activities aimed at differentiation or integration and employed policies and activities that possessed the capacity to optimize both simultaneously. In doing so, our study highlights new possibilities for complexity management by revealing the ways in which management activities can be designed to optimize both integration and differentiation.",2-s2.0-85026349211,3,2017,Organization Studies,0

Random digit dialing (RDD) can be costly for a rare population, but inexpensive convenience samples are unrepresentative by themselves. We combine biased estimates from an incomplete frame (a listed sample) with RDD estimates in a way that improves the accuracy (Mean Squared Error, MSE) of the RDD estimates compared to what would have been achieved without the incomplete frame data. Elliott and Haviland (2007) discuss this estimator when the bias of the incomplete frame estimator is known and discuss uncertainty in estimating bias; we describe an application that estimates incomplete frame bias relative to the RDD estimate for each parameter of interest, and conditions on that estimate. We discuss the extent to which this approach improves MSE relative to RDD alone and relative to a common alternative-stratified estimation based on whether a case appears in the incomplete frame. We surveyed 1,002 RDD and 1,023 listed households and examined the impact of incorporating listed estimates on MSE. Conditional on the bias estimate, MSE improved substantially for many outcomes because the estimated bias of listed sample estimates relative to RDD was small for most outcomes. For thirty-eight of forty-one estimates, including the listed sample (doubling the nominal sample size) produced MSEs equivalent to RDD sample sizes 1.22-1.85 times as large as the actual RDD sample size. Because the cost per listed complete was 20 percent of the cost per RDD complete, cost per effective sample size decreased relative to RDD alone for all but three estimates.",2-s2.0-72749087971,5,2009,Public Opinion Quarterly,0

I show that each practice is a self-enforcing convention, in Schelling's (1960) sense, maintained by interdependent expectations on the marriage market. Each practice originated under conditions of extreme resource polygyny as a means of enforcing the imperial male's exclusive sexual access to his female consorts. Extreme polygyny also caused a competitive upward flow of women and a downward flow of conjugal practices, accounting for diffusion of the practices. A Schelling coordination diagram explains how the three methods of the Chinese campaign to abolish footbinding succeeded in bringing it to a quick end. The pivotal innovation was to form associations of parents who pledged not to footbind their daughters nor let their sons marry footbound women.

Even as he recommends it as the extra-constitutional solution to the inefficiencies and insufficiencies of legislative constitutionalism, Locke's Second Treatise is far more aware of the dangers of executive prerogative than the more optimistic accounts in the recent scholarship have appreciated, making Locke pessimistic about the permanent sustenance of legislative constitutionalism. This pessimism stems from Locke's recognition that the people are far too constitutionally passive for the vigilance essential to ""umpire"" well the necessity of executive action outside the laws In fact, liberalism itself can contribute to such passivity: the people are content to allow an executive to act with a significant degree of discretion outside the laws so long as those actions do not interfere with their short-term interest in security and prosperity. Understanding Locke's pessimism regarding popular vigilance casts into new light his argument for a legislative constitutionalism based on fundamental laws that establish a clear separation of powers. Such fundamental laws provide legislative elites with the constitutional ""signals"" by which they can alert the otherwise slumbering people about an executive intent on usurpation and tyranny.",2-s2.0-35348839184,5,2007,American Political Science Review,0

There is also evidence that hostile-submissive behavior is frequently met with friendly-dominance. Conceptual and methodological problems with this research are discussed. The theory of interpersonal complementarity based on the idea of a shared definition of the encounter needs to be modified to take greater account of the factor of defense of status.

Hence, a change of the status quo has long-term consequences that groups need to take into account. Important applications of this model include lobbying for legislation and political transitions through revolutions. We analyse the strategic timing of attacks on the status quo, which is similar to investment decisions under uncertainty.We find that the attack threshold is considerably lower than in a comparable one-period game, and that the expenditure level necessary to change the status quo is low in comparison to the prize; this provides a possible solution to Tullock's rent-seeking paradox in lobbying.",2-s2.0-33645695122,2,2006,Review of Economic Studies,0

Our theory predicts that competition forces managers to promise portfolios that mimic Arrow-Debreu (AD) securities, which investors then combine to fit their preferences. A weak version of the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) obtains, where state prices (relative to state probabilities) implicit in prices of traded securities will be inversely ranked to aggregate wealth across states. Our experiment broadly corroborates the price and choice predictions of the theory. However, price quality deteriorates when only a few managers attract most of the available wealth. Wealth concentration increases because funds flow toward managers who offer portfolios closer to replicating AD securities (as in the theory), but also because funds flow to managers who had better performance in the immediate past (an observation unrelated to the theory).",2-s2.0-84938652009,3,2015,Management Science,0

What causes such radical group differences? We suggest, as have previous accounts, that this phenomenon is often motivated. However, the source of this motivation is not necessarily an aversion to the problem, per se, but an aversion to the solutions associated with the problem. This difference in underlying process holds important implications for understanding, predicting, and influencing motivated skepticism. In 4 studies, we tested this solution aversion explanation for why people are often so divided over evidence and why this divide often occurs so saliently across political party lines. Studies 1, 2, and 3-using correlational and experimental methodologies-demonstrated that Republicans' increased skepticism toward environmental sciences may be partly attributable to a conflict between specific ideological values and the most popularly discussed environmental solutions.

Institutional theory has focused on the movement towards, and maintenance of, isomorphic institutional environments. Unfortunately, little attention has been paid to the forces that change institutional environments. Starting with a discussion of the implications of isomorphism on performance, this article attempts to develop a taxonomy of organizations within an institutional environment in order to develop a theory of how organizations respond to violations of institutional norms with possible implications for institutional change. Essential to this theory is the importance of organizational diversity, risk aversion, the effect of isomorphism on performance, and the role of relative performance in maintaining isomorphism and providing incentives to change.",2-s2.0-0040633733,3,1998,Organization Studies,0

Choice consistency is measured as the variance of the random error component in the consumer utility function: the smaller this variance, the higher choice consistency. We hypothesize that due to increased choice difficulty, choice consistency decreases if attribute level differences increase while average utility level differences between alternatives remain the same. In our empirical illustration we focus on the impact of price level shifts on choice consistency in conjoint choice experiments.

This work explores the potential of revenue-sharing contracts to facilitate information sharing in a supply chain and mitigate the negative effects of information leakage. We consider a supplier who offers a revenuesharing contract to two competing retailers, one of whom has private information about uncertain market potential and orders first. This order information may be leaked to the uninformed retailer by the supplier to realize higher profits. We show that the incentives of the supplier and retailers are better aligned under a revenue-sharing contract, as opposed to under a wholesale-price contract, reducing the supplier's incentive to leak. This is true for a wide range of wholesale prices and revenue-share percentages and is more likely when the revenue-share percentage is higher and when variation in demand is greater. Preventing information leakage may result in higher profits not only for the informed retailer and supplier but surprisingly even for the uninformed retailer. Our results are robust when the model is generalized along various dimensions.",2-s2.0-84874748002,3,2013,Management Science,0

People have a tendency to marry within their social group or to marry a person who is close to them in status. Although many characteristics play a role in the choice of a spouse, sociologists have most often examined endogamy and homogamy with respect to race/ethnicity, religion, and socioeconomic status. I first give an overview of hypotheses on the causes of endogamy and homogamy. The various hypotheses that have been suggested in the literature can be distinguished as arguments about three more general factors: (a) the preferences of marriage candidates for certain characteristics in a spouse, (b) the interference of ""third parties"" in the selection process, and (c) the constraints of the marriage market in which candidates are searching for a spouse. Second, I summarize empirical research by answering four questions: (a) To what extent are groups endogamous and how do groups differ in this respect? (b) How has endogamy changed over time? (c) Which factors are related to endogamy? (d) How do various dimensions of partner choice coincide? Third, I discuss strengths and weaknesses of past research. Strengths include the mass of descriptive work that has been done and the development of a multifaceted theoretical perspective which gives sociological theorizing an edge over psychological and economic theories of partner choice. Weaknesses include the lack of standardization of methods in describing patterns and trends and the relatively weak integration of empirical and theoretical work.",2-s2.0-0032254027,7,1998,Annual Review of Sociology,0

A secondary objective was to examine whether one's ethnic group membership and ethnic identification serve as important factors that influence personal values as well as attitudes and patronage behavior in the context of regional shopping malls. The sample of regional mall shoppers consisted of white and Hispanic consumers residing in ten metropolitan cities of the southwest. Structural equation modeling indicated that both self-actualizing and social affiliation personal values were positively related to a favorable attitude toward regional shopping malls, and that the social affiliation value played a greater role in influencing attitude than did the self-actualizing value. Individual attitudes toward shopping malls, in turn, were a direct predictor of mall shopping behavior and mediated the relationship between personal values and attitudes. The findings indicate that, independent of ethnic group membership, both self-actualizing and social affiliation values can be used effectively to position regional malls in such a way as to reinforce these views and to provide a strong means for shoppers to satisfy these needs.",2-s2.0-0032020074,4,1998,Journal of Retailing,0

A situational learning orientation refers to the extent to which employees share the perception that there is an emphasis on improvement and on actively searching for additional knowledge and feedback in their department. The present study suggests that situational learning orientation interacts with two other organizational factors-autonomy and voice-as it influences employee errors, using the example of resident physicians' medical treatment errors. Senior nurses tallied the number of errors made by 123 residents from 25 departments over a three-month period. Results demonstrated that encouraging employee autonomy and voice fosters the benefits of learning by decreasing the number of treatment errors. Specifically, when the situational learning orientation was high, the number of errors decreased at an increasing rate as the perceived autonomy increased. When the learning orientation was low, there was a u-shaped relationship between autonomy and number of errors. In addition, only when the situational learning orientation was high did a higher employee voice lead to fewer treatment errors.",2-s2.0-61849090400,3,2008,Management Science,0

In this article, we present a perspective on the role of the hippocampal system in generalization, instantiated in a computational model called REMERGE (recurrency and episodic memory results in generalization). We expose a fundamental, but neglected, tension between prevailing computational theories that emphasize the function of the hippocampus in pattern separation (Marr, 1971; McClelland, McNaughton, & O'Reilly, 1995), and empirical support for its role in generalization and flexible relational memory (Cohen & Eichenbaum, 1993; Eichenbaum, 1999). Our account provides a means by which to resolve this conflict, by demonstrating that the basic representational scheme envisioned by complementary learning systems theory (McClelland et al., 1995), which relies upon orthogonalized codes in the hippocampus, is compatible with efficient generalization-as long as there is recurrence rather than unidirectional flow within the hippocampal circuit or, more widely, between the hippocampus and neocortex. We propose that recurrent similarity computation, a process that facilitates the discovery of higher-order relationships between a set of related experiences, expands the scope of classical exemplar-based models of memory (e.g., Nosofsky, 1984) and allows the hippocampus to support generalization through interactions that unfold within a dynamically created memory space.",2-s2.0-84867022077,6,2012,Psychological Review,0

To answer these questions, we use novel high frequency data from France on the incidence of a number of viral diseases across space, for different age groups, over a quarter of a century. We use quasi-experimental variation to evaluate the importance of policies reducing interpersonal contacts such as school closures or the closure of public transportation networks.

I propose a dynamic investment-based model to understand the impact of advertising expenditures on stock returns and firm value.

Using the Euler equations from the firm's maximization problem, I derive closed-form expressions for the firm's equilibrium stock returns and market value, which depend on observable firm characteristics. I test the model's predictions by the generalized method of moments and data from a large cross section of publicly traded firms. The model is able to match simultaneously the pattern of average stock returns and firm values of portfolios sorted on advertising expenditures that standard asset pricing models cannot. The estimation results also show that brand equity accounts for a substantial fraction of firm market value (about 23%), and that this value varies substantially across industries.

We investigate the role of sectoral labor productivity in explaining the process of structural transformation-the secular reallocation of labor across sectors-and the time path of aggregate productivity across countries. We measure sectoral labor productivity across countries using a model of the structural transformation. Productivity differences across countries are large in agriculture and services and smaller in manufacturing. Over time, productivity gaps have been substantially reduced in agriculture and industry but not nearly as much in services. These sectoral productivity patterns generate implications in the model that are broadly consistent with the cross-country data. We find that productivity catch-up in industry explains about 50% of the gains in aggregate productivity across countries, whereas low productivity in services and the lack of catch-up explain all the experiences of slowdown, stagnation, and decline observed across countries.",2-s2.0-76049115751,2,2010,Quarterly Journal of Economics,0

Recent research suggests that child well-being and subsequent status attainment are influenced not only by the duration of exposure to economic disadvantage during childhood, but also by the timing and sequencing of exposure. Unfortunately, traditional measures of children's economic deprivation typically fail to differentiate between exposures to disadvantage at different stages in childhood and largely ignore how economic circumstances change over time. In this article, the authors propose a new method for assessing economic disadvantage during childhood that simultaneously captures children's overall levels of exposure to economic disadvantage as well as the timing and sequencing of their exposure. This new method uses finite mixture modeling to classify children into a limited number of classes with similar histories of exposure to economic disadvantage. With this new methodology, it is possible both to assess how family characteristics affect patterns of exposure to disadvantage and to directly test alternative theories about the effect that different patterns of exposure have on achievement. The authors find that extended exposure to economic deprivation during childhood is least favorable to early adulthood achievement, but that - at least for human capital formation - the timing and sequencing of poverty also are important.",2-s2.0-33751235587,7,2006,American Sociological Review,0

What is the relationship between civic associations and authoritarian regimes? While Tocquevillian theories have concentrated mostly on the connection between civic associationism and democracy, this article develops a Gramscian approach, suggesting that a strong associational sphere can facilitate the development of authoritarian parties and hegemonic authoritarian regimes. Two countries are used for comparison, Italy from 1870 to 1926 and Spain from 1876 to 1926. The argument here is that the strength of the associational sphere in north-central Italy provided organizational resources to the fascist movement and then party. In turn, the formation of the party was a key reason why the Italian regime developed as a hegemonic authoritarian regime. The absence of a strong associational sphere in Spain explains why that regime developed as an economic corporate dictatorship, despite many similarities between the two cases.",2-s2.0-20844437255,7,2005,American Sociological Review,0

We adopt a multilevel framework that allows neighborhood and district effects to randomly influence household victimization. We find that economically vulnerable households, households living close to unsafe areas, and shop owners are more prone to suffer from riots. Households report lower levels of victimization if they live further from police stations, exhibit higher levels of trust, are able to rely on outside help in times of need and accumulate savings. The results show, however, a double-edge effect of income: wealthier households are better able to cope with the adverse effects of riots, but also have more to lose from riots and are more exposed to opportunistic violence and looting. We find further that affluent neighborhoods and neighborhoods where caste fragmentation is high report higher levels of victimization.

The literature on development nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) envisions an alternative form of social organization, one that is more altruistic, more cooperative, and less hierarchical than governments and for-profit organizations. We engage with the literature on quite different terms: NGOs and their donors are organizations, and much of what is distinctive about them as organizations derives from the special uncertainties they face due to the environments in which they operate, the goals they pursue, and the social and material technologies they employ.

3154,59714,Lider J.,The Correlation of World Forces: The Soviet Concept,"The Correlation of World Forces: The Soviet Concept. Four questions in the Soviet concept of the correlation of world forces are discussed: The actors, the forces, the character of the correlation, and the role of the correlation in world development. The discussion concludes with a comment on the differences between the Soviet and the Western approaches. The Soviet concept differs from the traditional notion of the balance of power in three respects. First, it is based on the Marxist-Leninist philosophy, which sees the world as evolving according to the laws of history towards socialism; a favourable correlation of world forces is both the outcome of such a development and a condition of further progress. Secondly, Soviet politicians and scholars regard the international system as based on the interaction of two antagonistic camps, opposed to each other in their socio-economic and political systems, doctrines, and policies. Finally, the concept seems to entail three, or even four, kinds of correlation: 1) the correlation of power on the global scale; 2) the correlation on the highly important regional scale, i. e. which concerns the power of the Warsaw Treaty states and the NATO states in Europe; and 3) the correlation, within the socialist system, of the power of the Soviet Union and other states. Recently a fourth kind of correlation has been included: That between the Soviet Union and China, and it is regarded as playing a significant role in the world equation of power. Balance of power theories and models based on the concept of the interplay of a number of great powers are dismissed by Soviet scholars as outmoded and artificial, distort ing the real correlation of forces between the actual competitors. In spite of Soviet argumentation, the differences between Soviet and the traditional con cepts are not very clear. This is because the Soviet concept is treated as a means of policy rather than as a scientific construction. It is used to justify the status of the Soviet Union as one of the two leading world powers capable of backing by its military posture a widening range of interests; further to confirm Soviet predominance in the socialist camp; finally, to buttress the bargaining position of the Soviet Union in negotiations concerning arms control and regional cocrrelation of forces.",2-s2.0-84965799944,5,1980,Journal of Peace Research,0

We construct an econometric general equilibrium model of the US to demonstrate that social cost estimates diverge sharply from private cost estimates.

3156,54397,Kim S.,Public Reason Confucianism: A Construction,"Public Reason Confucianism: A Construction. If perfectionism is understood as the state's non-neutral promotion of a valuable way of life, Confucian political theory, often pursued as a pluralist correction to global monism of liberal democracy, is ineluctably perfectionist. But how can Confucian perfectionism, committed to particular Confucian values, reconcile with the societal fact of value pluralism within the putative Confucian polity? This article argues that a potential tension between Confucian perfectionism and value pluralism can be avoided by making Confucian perfectionist goods the core elements of public reason with which citizens can justify their arguments to one another and by which the state can justifiably exercise its public authority to reasonable citizens who otherwise subscribe to various comprehensive doctrines. By defining a mode of Confucian perfectionism working through Confucian public reason broadly shared by citizens as public reason Confucianism, this article attempts to balance the Confucian polity's internal societal pluralism and the people's collective self-determination.

The present research examined whether a communicator’s verbal, implicit message regarding a target is used as a cue for inferring that communicator’s social identity. Previous research has found linguistic intergroup bias (LIB) in individuals’ speech: They use abstract language to describe in-group targets’ desirable behaviors and concrete language to describe their undesirable behaviors (favorable LIB), but use concrete language for out-group targets’ desirable behaviors and abstract language for their undesirable behaviors (unfavorable LIB). Consequently, one can infer the type of language a communicator is likely to use to describe in-group and out-group targets. We hypothesized and found evidence for the reverse inference. Across four studies, individuals inferred a communicator’s social identity on the basis of the communicator’s use of an LIB. Specifically, participants more strongly believed that a communicator and target shared a social identity when the communicator used the favorable, rather than the unfavorable, LIB in describing that target.",2-s2.0-84954145597,6,2016,Psychological Science,0

Co-evolution is generated by two elements missing in previous analyses: securitisation and bank equity capital. As banks evolve via improvements in credit screening, they securitise higher quality credits. This encourages greater investor participation and spurs capital market evolution. And, if capital market evolution is spurred by greater investor participation, banks find it cheaper to raise equity capital to satisfy endogenously arising risk-sensitive capital requirements. Bank evolution is thus stimulated as banks consequently serve previously unserved high-risk borrowers. Numerous additional results are obtained.",2-s2.0-77956260486,2,2010,Economic Journal,0

This article analyzes the practice of opportunistic poaching of consultants by clients, with particular reference to the business consulting industry. The strategic interaction of consulting groups, client firms, and consultants gives rise to a market equilibrium in a mixed economy. Under very general conditions, whenever a match client-consultant is formed, a pure strategy equilibrium exists where the consulting group pleases the client's request and the consultant is poached by the client. Thus, the equilibrium quality of the consulting services market does not depend only on the consulting group's assignment strategy but also on the clients' poaching behavior (consumption externality).

Drawing from a qualitative, empirical study of work experiences in a North American organic supermarket, we introduce the notion of ‘enchanting work’, a polyvalent concept referring to the aura found in certain forms of service work in contrast to the disenchantment commonly associated with it. Enchanting work, because of its unique stance vis-a-vis workplace critique and commitment, can inform the study of work by moving beyond the dichotomy of meaningful versus alienated work. Our findings show how enchanting work can be found on three different levels to (1) infuse otherwise mundane work processes with meaning, (2) obscure organizational control mechanisms and divert attention from precarious work conditions, and (3) recruit the participation of workers for creating an enchanted workplace. We discuss the implications of our results for understanding contemporary worlds of work and explore both the emancipatory and ideological ramifications of enchanting work.",2-s2.0-84946089781,3,2015,Organization Studies,0

The Shapley-Owen value (SOV, Owen and Shapley 1989, Optimal location of candidates in ideological space. International Journal of Game Theory 125-42), a generalization of the Shapley-Shubik value applicable to spatial voting games, is an important concept in that it takes us away from a priori concepts of power to notions of power that are directly tied to the ideological proximity of actors. SOVs can also be used to locate the spatial analogue to the Copeland winner, the strong point, the point with smallest win-set, which is a plausible solution concept for games without cores. However, for spatial voting games with many voters, until recently, it was too computationally difficult to calculate SOVs, and thus, it was impossible to find the strong point analytically. After reviewing the properties of the SOV, such as the result proven by Shapley and Owen that size of win sets increases with the square of distance as we move away from the strong point along any ray, we offer a computer algorithm for computing SOVs that can readily find such values even for legislatures the size of the U.S. House of Representatives or the Russian Duma. We use these values to identify the strong point and show its location with respect to the uncovered set, for several of the U.S. congresses analyzed in Bianco, Jeliazkov, and Sened (2004, The limits of legislative actions: Determining the set of enactable outcomes given legislators preferences.

Two long-standing research problems of interest to sociologists are sources of variations in social inequalities and differential contributions of the temporal dimensions of age, time period, and cohort to variations in social phenomena. Recently, scholars have introduced a model called Variance Function Regression for the study of the former problem, and a model called Hierarchical Age-Period-Cohort regression has been developed for the study of the latter. This article presents an integration of these two models as a means to study the evolution of social inequalities along distinct temporal dimensions. We apply the integrated model to survey data on subjective health status. We find substantial age, period, and cohort effects, as well as gender differences, not only for the conditional mean of self-rated health (i.e., between-group disparities), but also for the variance in this mean (i.e., within-group disparities)-and it is detection of age, period, and cohort variations in the latter disparities that application of the integrated model permits. Net of effects of age and individual-level covariates, in recent decades, cohort differences in conditional means of self-rated health have been less important than period differences that cut across all cohorts. By contrast, cohort differences of variances in these conditional means have dominated period differences. In particular, post-baby boom birth cohorts show significant and increasing levels of within-group disparities. These findings illustrate how the integrated model provides a powerful framework through which to identify and study the evolution of variations in social inequalities across age, period, and cohort temporal dimensions. Accordingly, this model should be broadly applicable to the study of social inequality in many different substantive contexts.",2-s2.0-82455212336,7,2011,American Sociological Review,0

To test cross-culture predictability in international retailing, we develop a novel text mining procedure to elicit the specific cultural content of the product using consumers' online product reviews. In addition, to measure the general cultural environment of the market, we apply Hofstede's cultural distance measure. To explain foreign markets' acceptance of culturally specific elements, we theorize that the relationship between inter-country cultural distance and product sales is U shaped because of both cultural discount and cultural premium. In our empirical analysis using American movies in international retailing, we find that the two specified types of cultural factors determine a movie's success, along with the movie's characteristics and the market's economic environment.

The paper reports the results of three studies comparing two different forms of these status judgments. The first form are autonomous judgments of pride and respect that are linked to the characteristics associated with membership in different groups. People link such judgments to inclusion or membership in the group. The second are comparative judgments of pride and respect that are linked to comparisons of one's status to the status of other people or groups. The results indicate that, within groups, people are influenced primarily by autonomous assessments of status based on their internal standards, which develop from the status associated with prototypical characteristics linked to inclusion in a group. People are less strongly influenced by comparisons of their status to the status of external comparison standards. Further, justice-based status inferences are shown to be primarily autonomous, and not comparative, in nature.",2-s2.0-0036741003,3,2002,Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes,0

We present a model to address in a unified manner four ways in which a monopolist can interfere with secondary markets. In the model, consumers have heterogeneous valuations for quality so that used-good markets play an allocative role. Our results are the following: (1) In contrast to Swan's famous independence result, a monopolist does not provide socially optimal durability. (2) Allowing the monopolist to rent does not restore socially optimal durability and increases the monopolist's market power in the used market. However, forcing the monopolist to sell the goods may be a bad policy because it would lead to either lower output or lower durability. (3) The manufacturer benefits from a well functioning used-good market despite the fact that used goods provide competition for new goods. (4) The monopolist prefers to restrict consumers' abilities to maintain the good.",2-s2.0-0033421219,2,1999,RAND Journal of Economics,0
3176,53964,Rogers J.R.,Information and judicial review: A signaling game of legislative-judicial interaction,"Information and judicial review: A signaling game of legislative-judicial interaction. This article develops a simple signaling game in which a Legislative and a Court interact in seeking thier own policy goals. The Legislative faces two sources of uncertainty when legislating. First, it knows only probabilistically whether the Court's preferences converge or diverge from its own on the proposed law. Second, its know only probabilistically the true state of the world and, hence, does not know with certainty whether the law will reasonably achieve its intended outcome if enacted. For institutional and sequential reasons, the Courts has more information regarding the actual consequences of an enacted law than the Legislature did when initially considering it. As a result, the Court's exercise of the judicial veto may (but not necessarily will) be informationally productive. The possibilty of informative judicial review affects the quantity and informational quality of legislation enacted by the Legisiature relative to legislation that would be enacted in the absence of judicial review. Further, an informational component to judicial review alters the incentive that the Court has to act strategically relative to incentive for strategic behavior in purely distributive models of legislative-judicial interaction. Finally, because of the possibility of informative judicial review, the model accounts endogenously for the creation and maintenance of an independent judiciary by a Legislative that solely values achieving its preferred policy outcomes.",2-s2.0-0035529090,5,2001,American Journal of Political Science,0

In situations where a sequence of forecasts is observed, a common strategy is to examine ""rationality"" conditional on a given loss function. We examine this from a different perspective - supposing that we have a family of loss functions indexed by unknown shape parameters, then given the forecasts can we back out the loss function parameters consistent with the forecasts being rational even when we do not observe the underlying forecasting model? We establish identification of the parameters of a general class of loss functions that nest popular loss functions as special cases and provide estimation methods and asymptotic distributional results for these parameters. This allows us to construct new tests of forecast rationality that allow for asymmetric loss. The methods are applied in an empirical analysis of IMF and OECD forecasts of budget deficits for the G7 countries.

I present a model in which rational policy-makers learn about the behavior of the economy in real time and set stabilization policy optimally, conditional on their current beliefs. The steady state associated with the self-confirming equilibrium of the model is characterized by low inflation. However, prolonged episodes of high inflation ending with rapid disinflations can occur when policy-makers underestimate both the natural rate of unemployment and the persistence of inflation in the Phillips curve. I estimate the model using likelihood methods. The estimation results show that the model accounts remarkably well for the evolution of policy-makers' beliefs, stabilization policy, and the postwar behavior of inflation and unemployment in the United States.",2-s2.0-33746633914,2,2006,Quarterly Journal of Economics,0

We develop a global equilibrium asset pricing model assuming that investors suffer from foreign aversion, a preference for home assets based on familiarity. Using a utility formulation inspired by regret theory, we derive closed-form solutions. When the degree of foreign aversion is high in a given country, investors place a high valuation on domestic equity, which results in a low expected return. Thus, the model generates the simple prediction that a country's degree of home bias and the expected return of its domestic assets should be inversely related. Our predicted relation between the degree of home bias and a country's expected return has the opposite sign predicted by models that assume some form of market segmentation. Using International Monetary Fund portfolio data, we find that expected returns are negatively related to home bias.",2-s2.0-84861399130,3,2012,Management Science,0

In many applications of instrumental-variables regression, researchers seek to defend the plausibility of a key assumption: the instrumental variable is independent of the error term in a linear regression model. Although fulfilling this exogeneity criterion is necessary for a valid application of the instrumental-variables approach, it is not sufficient. In the regression context, the identification of causal effects depends not just on the exogeneity of the instrument but also on the validity of the underlying model. In this article, I focus on one feature of such models: the assumption that variation in the endogenous regressor that is related to the instrumental variable has the same effect as variation that is unrelated to the instrument. In many applications, this assumption may be quite strong, but relaxing it can limit our ability to estimate parameters of interest. After discussing two substantive examples, I develop analytic results (simulations are reported elsewhere).

Each voter recognizes that, during experimentation, other voters also learn about their preferences. As a result, pivotal voters today are biased against experimentation because it reduces their likelihood of remaining pivotal. This phenomenon reduces equilibrium experimentation below the socially efficient level, and may even result in a negative option value of experimentation. However, one can restore efficiency by designing a voting rule that depends deterministically on time. Another main result is that even when payoffs of a reform are independently distributed across the population, good news about any individual's payoff increases other individuals' incentives to experiment with that reform, due to a positive voting externality.",2-s2.0-77954092250,2,2010,Econometrica,0

In our model, the retailer engages in simultaneous bilateral negotiations with all manufacturers. Our model and analysis produce managerial insights that could not be obtained in the absence of a bargaining perspective on assortment planning. For example, we find that when a manufacturer improves its product, such improvements not only benefit the retailer but might even benefit competing manufacturers.

In contrast, the considerable freedom that senators have to stake out a position of their choice on the hawk/dove continuum can be seen in the weak coefficients of determination between a senators position and those of his or her predecessors and contemporary fellow senator from the same state. As for the military-industrial complex, traces of its influence are, during the 1970s, at best weakly associated with a senators hawkishness or dovishness. There are indications of a modest effect of defense-related PACs on roll-call voting in the early 1980s.

Various determinants have been proposed to explain the persistence of nationally-bound administrative heritages. In this paper, we propose an overall model that integrates these contingent determinants. Our model is based on historical analysis, a method of theory building that first conceptualizes a model and then utilizes it as an exploratory lens for viewing historical evidence. The originality of our model comes from the theory-based bias that we introduce into the model as a way to avoid the trap of multi-causalism. Specifically, we select a nation's educational system as our model's leading determinant, for educational institutions and particularly schools more than other institutions both shape a nation's beliefs about ""how things ought to be done,"" and transmit those beliefs and practices to successive generations. We draw the theoretical grounding for this bias using a theory of socialization which posits that the schemas that individuals internalize during their early formative stages of development greatly influence the way that they will later construct reality. We found our model to be useful in clarifying the underlying historical reasons why British and French firms rely on different integrative mechanisms when establishing headquarters-subsidiary linkages. Indeed, by analyzing the history of these two nations and the routines and rationalities imposed by their respective set of institutions in the context of our model, we find an overall mosaic, or gestalt, that is fully consistent with their present-day administrative practices. For example, we find that French managers today tend to heavily rely on centralized controls and headquarters intervention because of the influences of a number of key historical elements. These include the way their ancestors dealt with threats of invasion and ethnic diversity; the leadership styles of past French monarchies and elected officials; the manner in which the French colonies were controlled and the French school system organized; and the way the French government responded to economic problems that came from being a late participant in the two industrial revolutions. These also include the philosophies of the revered seventeenth-century French thinkers; the family structures that have existed in France since the middle ages; and the enduring influence of the Catholic ethos. Similarly, we use our model to present a different, yet equally compelling, mosaic image to explain why British managers have tended to rely on an administrative heritage, based on decentralization, ""laissez-faire"" and autonomy. Finally, and perhaps most important, we show that the explanation we arrived at using this inductive method of theory building is fully consistent with the empirical conclusions we derived using contemporary methods of organization science. In so doing, we demonstrate that these two approaches, when combined, can inform and enrich theory building and thereby lead to a more thorough understanding of organizational phenomena such as administrative heritage.",2-s2.0-1542738897,3,1997,Organization Science,0

In three studies we investigate how values moderate the effect of raising the salience of group heterogeneity (versus homogeneity) on tolerance. As hypothesized, the findings indicate that conservation values moderate the effects of the saliency of the group's heterogeneity. People high on conservation values were more tolerant when the group's homogeneity was made salient than when its heterogeneity was made salient. People low on conservation were either insensitive to information on the group's heterogeneity (Studies 1 and 2), or were more tolerant when the group's heterogeneity was made salient than when its homogeneity was made salient (Study 3). Values are also directly associated with tolerance: conservation values (as well as SDO and RWA in Study 3) were negatively associated whereas openness-to-change and self-transcendence values were positively associated with tolerance.

Our previous research demonstrated that psychopathy-related fear deficits involve abnormalities in attention that undermine sensitivity to peripheral information. In the present study, we specified this attention-mediated abnormality in a new sample of 87 prisoners assessed with Hare's Psychopathy Checklist-Revised (Hare, 2003). We measured fear-potentiated startle (FPS) under four conditions that crossed attentional focus (threat vs. alternative) with early versus late presentation of threat cues. The psychopathic deficit in FPS was apparent only in the early-alternative-focus condition, in which threat cues were presented after the alternative goal-directed focus was established. Furthermore, psychopathy interacted with working memory capacity in the late-alternative-focus condition, which suggests that individuals high in psychopathy and working memory capacity were able to maintain a set-related alternative focus that reduced FPS. The results not only provide new evidence that attention moderates the fearlessness of psychopathic individuals, but also implicate an early attention bottleneck as a proximal mechanism for deficient response modulation in psychopathy.",2-s2.0-79952060169,6,2011,Psychological Science,0

Examining the direct and moderating effects of violence on suicidal behavior. Although interpersonal violence and suicide are two of the leading causes of death among young Americans, analyses focusing simultaneously on violence and suicide in sociological inquiry are sparse. Analyses also tend to be limited by their focus on either the individual-level predictors of suicidal behaviors or the aggregate-level predictors of suicide rates, despite the recognition that psychological and sociological forces contribute independently as well as interactively to facilitate suicide. To address these issues, I use data from the Project onHuman Development in Chicago Neighborhoods (PHDCN) to examine the direct and moderating effects of individual- and neighborhood-level violence on attempted suicide. Estimates from hierarchical logistic regression models indicate that individual acts of violent aggression, but not neighborhood levels of violence, increase the likelihood of attempting suicide. Furthermore, the well-established relationship between depression and attempted suicide is conditioned by individual- and neighborhood-level violence, such that the effect of depression is (1) amplified for individuals living in neighborhoods characterized by violence and (2) attenuated for individuals engaging in violent behavior. Finally, the combined effect of neighborhood violence and individual violent aggression on the depression/suicide relationship is greater than the partial moderating effects of these variables.",2-s2.0-84881339804,7,2013,Social Problems,0

While competition is important to religious leaders' actions, its effects can be understood only in relation to other crucial characteristics of the social environment within which leaders operate. These characteristics, which we derive from Neo-Institutional Theory (NIT), shape leaders' interests and often lead them to prioritize concerns about their institutions' legitimacy over the concerns about efficiency and growth rational choice theorists assume are predominant. Most NIT studies examine the population of firms within one organizational field. Because we hold firm constant and examine how variation in the type of organizational field (supplied by the more than 100 countries in our analyses) predicts firm leaders' actions, this study represents a unique test of NIT.",2-s2.0-77957902447,7,2010,American Sociological Review,0

While in systems in which power is concentrated the two motivations converge, in consensual systems they diverge: since votes will likely be watered down by bargaining in the parliament, outcome-oriented choice in consensual systems often leads voters to endorse parties whose positions differ from their own views. In the second step, I utilize institutional measures of power diffusion in the parliament to account for the degree to which voters in different polities pursue one motivation versus the other. I demonstrate that the more power diffusion and compromise built into the political system via institutional mechanisms, the more voters compensate for the watering down of their vote by endorsing parties whose positions differ from their own views.",2-s2.0-24944447987,5,2005,Political Analysis,0

This paper presents a combined relational and cultural approach to transnational institution building by focusing on a network analysis of a small collegial oligarchy and normative alignments among its peers. To contribute to a theory of institutionalization, we propose hypotheses about whom professionals as institutional entrepreneurs are likely to select as members of their collegial oligarchy, about the role of social networks among them in identifying these leaders, and about the costs of alignments on these leaders’ normative choices. We test these hypotheses using mainly Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGMs) applied to a dataset including network information and normative choices collected at the so-called Venice Forum – a field-configuring event that was central in creating and mobilizing a network of European patent judges for the construction of a new transnational institution, the European Unified Patent Court. We track normative alignments on the collegial hierarchy in this network of judges and their divergent interpretations of the contemporary European patent. Highlighting this under-examined articulation of relational infrastructures and cultural framing in transnational institutionalization shows how Northern European forms of capitalism tend to dominate in this institutionalization process at the expense of the Southern European forms. It also helps reflect on the usefulness of analyses of small networks of powerful players in organizational societies, where power and influence are highly concentrated.",2-s2.0-84985986850,7,2017,Social Networks,0

We compare a fully parametric hazard model with discrete-time survival mixture analysis (DTSMA) in our study of data drawn from 70 countries from different economic sectors and geographic regions. Both approaches use control variables to capture observed heterogeneity. The possible relative advantage of DTSMA is its ability to recognize unobserved heterogeneity using latent classes. Failure to account for unobserved heterogeneity can cause underestimation of hazard probabilities; we investigate the change in inferences such an omission may cause. Applying DTSMA to this data set, we find that model parameters have appropriate signs and offer support for all three hypotheses: Relatively falling prices, relatively greater number of competitors, and relatively fewer competing standards are each associated with relatively higher hazard probabilities. In contrast, in the estimation of the fully parametric hazard model, we find that some parameters are wrongly signed, and only one hypothesis, the effect of competing standards, is supported.",2-s2.0-79957928913,4,2011,Marketing Letters,0

We then show that when poll leads are properly discounted, poll-based forecasts outperform vote-share market prices. Moreover, we show that win projections based on the polls dominate prices from winner-take-all markets.

To understand how and whether international legal commitments affect state behavior, one must control for all sources of selection into the treaty - including those that are not directly observable. I develop a statistical method that controls for such sources of selection and find considerable evidence that the unobservable conditions that lead states to make the legal commitment to Article VIII have a notable impact on their propensity to engage in compliant behavior.

Yet, different agreements provide different information.

We wish to disentangle two mechanisms by which local competition influences a dealer's inventory: (1) the entry or exit of a competitor can change a retailer's demand (a sales effect); and (2) the entry or exit of a competitor can change the amount of buffer stock a retailer holds, which influences the probability that a consumer finds a desired product in stock (a service-level effect). Theory is clear on the sales effect-an increase in sales leads to an increase in inventory (albeit a less than proportional increase). However, theoretical models of inventory competition are ambiguous on the expected sign of the service-level effect. Via a Web crawler, we obtained data on inventory and sales for more than 200 dealerships over a six-month period. Using cross-sectional variation, we estimated the effect of the number and type of local competitors on inventory holdings.

International crises are modeled as a political “war of attrition” in which state leaders choose at each moment whether to attack, back down, or escalate. A leader who backs down suffers audience costs that increase as the public confrontation proceeds. Equilibrium analysis shows how audience costs enable leaders to learn an adversary's true preferences concerning settlement versus war and thus whether and when attack is rational. The model also generates strong comparative statics results, mainly on the question of which side is most likely to back down. Publicly observable measures of relative military capabilities and relative interests prove to have no direct effect once a crisis begins. Instead, relative audience costs matter: the side with a stronger domestic audience (e.g., a democracy) is always less likely to back down than the side less able to generate audience costs (a nondemocracy).

Although it is well established that regions of premotor cortex (PMC) are active during action observation, it remains controversial whether they play a causal role in action understanding. In the experiment reported here, we used off-line continuous theta-burst stimulation (cTBS) to investigate this question. Participants received cTBS over the hand and lip areas of left PMC, in separate sessions, before completing a pantomime-recognition task in which half of the trials contained pantomimed hand actions, and half contained pantomimed mouth actions. The results reveal a double dissociation: Participants were less accurate in recognizing pantomimed hand actions after receiving cTBS over the hand area than over the lip area and less accurate in recognizing pantomimed mouth actions after receiving cTBS over the lip area than over the hand area. This finding constrains theories of action understanding by showing that somatotopically organized regions of PMC contribute causally to action understanding and, thus, that the mechanisms underpinning action understanding and action performance overlap.",2-s2.0-84898840741,6,2014,Psychological Science,0

Research linking religion to prejudice suggests that highly religious individuals, and religious fundamentalists specifically, may be especially susceptible to expressing prejudice toward dissimilar others, whereas people who are less religious and fundamentalist do not show the same effect. The selective prejudice hypothesis predicts that this pattern of results occurs because the cognitive and motivational styles or particular values associated with fundamentalism exacerbate prejudice. In 3 studies, using 4 data sets (N = 6,047), we test this selective prejudice hypothesis against the religious values conflict hypothesis, which predicts that both people with high and low levels of fundamentalism will be prejudiced toward those with dissimilar beliefs to protect the validity and vitality of people's belief systems. Consistent with the religious values conflict hypothesis, we found that people both high and low in fundamentalism were prejudiced toward dissimilar others (Study 1) and these differences were primarily due to differences in the content of religious belief rather than the style of belief (Study 2). In Study 3, we expanded these findings to additional measures of prejudice, found that multiple measures of threat were potential mediators, and explored the possibility of an integrative perspective. In total, these results suggest that people with both relatively high and low levels of fundamentalism are susceptible to prejudice and in some cases the size of this religious intergroup bias may be higher among people with high levels of fundamentalism.",2-s2.0-85007494947,6,2017,Journal of Personality and Social Psychology,0

This article presents Saul Alinsky's theory of community organizing as a democratic alternative to political realism's fixation on the coercive authority of the state and the ethical problems of statesmanship. Alinsky shows how the organizer can be used as a paradigmatic political actor in developing an approach to political ethics that treats power and self-interest as ethical concepts on which to construct a radical vision of democratic politics. His morality of power consists of learning how to use relational power and thick self-interest to develop democratic forms of deliberation and action. In contrast to the aim of the statesman, the organizer's goal is not simply to acquire power and learn how to wield it: An organizer helps the powerless learn how to use and think about power for themselves. Organizing is realist, pedagogical, and democratic, and Alinsky's ability to hold these ideas together makes him an important theorist of democratic agency in undemocratic times.",2-s2.0-85007495956,5,2016,American Political Science Review,0

In distinction, this paper proposes selecting the weights by minimizing a Mallows criterion, the latter an estimate of the average squared error from the model average fit. We show that our new Mallows model average (MMA) estimator is asymptotically optimal in the sense of achieving the lowest possible squared error in a class of discrete model average estimators. In a simulation experiment we show that the MMA estimator compares favorably with those based on AIC and BIC weights.

A Bayesian analysis is performed of what optimal estimations would be if categories formed a disjoint partitioning of the object space and if features were independently displayed within a category. This Bayesian analysis is placed within an incremental categorization algorithm. The resulting rational model accounts for effects of central tendency of categories, effects of specific instances, learning of linearly nonseparable categories, effects of category labels, extraction of basic level categories, base-rate effects, probability matching in categorization, and trial-by-trial learning functions. Al-though the rational model considers just 1 level of categorization, it is shown how predictions can be enhanced by considering higher and lower levels. Considering prediction at the lower, individual level allows integration of this rational analysis of categorization with the earlier rational analysis of memory (Anderson & Milson, 1989).",2-s2.0-0000705894,6,1991,Psychological Review,0

An alternative cognitive model of drug use and drug urges is proposed that hypothesizes that drug use in the addict is controlled by automatized action schemata.

Debate surrounding the issue of inequality and hierarchy between social groups has become increasingly prominent in recent years. At the same time, individuals disagree about the extent to which inequality between advantaged and disadvantaged groups exists. Whereas prior work has examined the ways in which individuals legitimize (or delegitimize) inequality as a function of their motivations, we consider whether individuals' orientation toward group-based hierarchy motivates the extent to which they perceive inequality between social groups in the first place. Across 8 studies in both real-world (race, gender, and class) and artificial contexts, and involving members of both advantaged and disadvantaged groups, we show that the more individuals endorse hierarchy between groups, the less they perceive inequality between groups at the top and groups at the bottom. Perceiving less inequality is associated with rejecting egalitarian social policies aimed at reducing it. We show that these differences in hierarchy perception as a function of individuals' motivational orientation hold even when inequality is depicted abstractly using images, and even when individuals are financially incentivized to accurately report their true perceptions. Using a novel methodology to assess accurate memory of hierarchy, we find that differences may be driven by both antiegalitarians underestimating inequality, and egalitarians overestimating it. In sum, our results identify a novel perceptual bias rooted in individuals' chronic motivations toward hierarchy-maintenance, with the potential to influence their policy attitudes.",2-s2.0-84964507592,6,2017,Journal of Personality and Social Psychology,0

Disparities in cesarean rates in the United States represent an important social problem because cesareans are related to maternal deaths and to the high cost of American health care. There are pervasive racial-ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in maternity care as in health care more generally, yet there has been little scrutiny of how overuse of cesarean deliveries might be linked to these disparities. There are at least two possibilities when it comes to c-sections: black, Hispanic, Native American, and low socioeconomic status (SES) mothers could be less likely to have needed cesareans, leading to more negative outcomes for both mothers and babies, or they could be more likely to have medically unnecessary cesareans, leading to more negative outcomes as a result of the surgery itself. This research uses data on all recorded births in the United States in 2006 to analyze differences in the odds of a cesarean delivery by race-ethnicity and SES. The analysis reveals that non-Hispanic black, Hispanic/Latina, and Native American mothers are more likely to have cesarean deliveries than non-Hispanic white or Asian mothers. Also, after accounting for medical indications, increasing education is associated with a decline in odds of a cesarean delivery, especially for non- Hispanic whites.

We explain these channel-shift patterns as an increase in ""research online, purchase offline"" behavior enabled by BOPS implementation, and we validate this explanation with evidence from the change of cart abandonment and conversion rates of the brick-and-mortar and online channels. We interpret these results in light of recent operations management literature that analyzes the impact of sharing inventory availability information. Our analysis illustrates the limitations of drawing conclusions about complex interventions using single-channel data.",2-s2.0-84902251292,3,2014,Management Science,0

Leslie (1987) has proposed a cognitivist model for the young child's ""theory of mind"" and capacity to pretend. Serious shortcomings in Leslie's nondevelopmental, nonsocial, and restrictively cognitive account are noted, and an alternative thesis is proposed: A young child's knowledge about people is grounded in the experience of affectively charged interpersonal relations, and the child's capacity for pretend play develops on the basis of prior abilities to perceive the nature of other people's relatedness to the world. Clinical phenomena associated with autism and congenital blindness provide evidence for this thesis.",2-s2.0-0025069190,6,1990,Psychological Review,0

A meta-analytic integration is reported which summarizes the effects of positional centrality on communication network member behavior. Three distinct components of centrality are considered (Degree, Betweenness, and Closeness) along with three classes of behavior (Leadership, Satisfaction, and Participation). Results indicate that each component of centrality is a significant, moderate predictor of network member behavior. However, after partialling out the effects of the other two components, Betweenness and Degree were each still found to be significant, independent predictors of Leadership, Satisfaction, and Participation (with Betweenness being significantly superior to Degree in predicting Leadership). Moreover, Closeness was not found to be a significant, independent predictor of any behaviors. This is noteworthy, insofar as Closeness corresponds to the original social psychological conceptualization of ""centrality"". Discussion considers the implications of these findings for communication networks in general, and in particular the growing interest in computer-mediated communication systems.",2-s2.0-0001634761,7,1991,Social Networks,0

The sample, extracted from 1980 Public Use Census data, consists of black and white male youths, aged 17-20, residing in central cities. Controlling for a number of individual and city characteristics, we find that the absolute and relative probabilities of employment for young black men are hurt by being in a city with a higher proportion of blacks, up to a tipping point of about 50 percent black. Thereafter, blacks’ absolute and relative employment odds are positively associated with the proportion black. This is consistent with the nonlinear version of the competition thesis proposed by Blalock (1957) and Lieberson (1980), and with economists' notion of employment discrimination based on the tastes of customers and coworkers.",2-s2.0-84929062986,7,1989,Social Forces,0

Two experiments examined the effect of interacting with a virtual object (object interactivity) on true and false memories. Although object interactivity may improve memory of associations compared to static pictures and text, it may lead to the creation of vivid internally generated recollections that pose as real memories. Consequently, compared to information conveyed via static pictures and text, object interactivity may cause people to falsely recognize more nonpresented features. The results support these hypotheses and provide converging evidence that this false-recognition effect is due to using imagery during retrieval and is robust, emerging regardless of individuals' goals (to search or browse) or learning intent.",2-s2.0-33845744950,4,2006,Journal of Consumer Research,0

We argue that consilience, or the unity of all knowledge, is an important goal for all researchers to pursue. The philosophical foundations of this position are explored, and then an empirical study is presented that illustrates what could be gained by melding behaviour genetic, sociological and other perspectives on politics. Twin data are analysed to examine the extent to which sociological factors can explain the variation in three dependent variables: left/liberal versus right/conservative political orientations; party identification; and interest in politics. The results indicate that large amounts of the variance in these variables are not explained by the sociological predictors, so the residual variance is tested for genetic influences, which yields fairly high heritability estimates. We conclude that analyses that are informed by both genetic and sociological insights are essential for understanding the phenomena examined, and explore the implications of this conclusion for conventional research paradigms and for consilience.",2-s2.0-85025079424,7,2017,Sociology,0

Utilizing data from the Toledo Adolescent Relationships Study and the 2000 U.S. Census, this study assesses whether sex ratios influence the formation and stability of emerging adults' romantic relationships. Findings show that relationship formation is unaffected by partner availability, yet the presence of partners increases women's odds of cohabiting, decreases men's odds of cohabiting, and increases number of dating partners and cheating among men. It appears that sex ratios influence not only transitions in and out of marriage, but also the process through which individuals search for and evaluate partners prior to marriage.",2-s2.0-84873722283,7,2011,Social Forces,0

This paper is about the conditions under which simple social psychological processes can affect collective decisions. In rational choice theory, social psychological effects are said to cancel out, be randomized, or be corrected by communication. Yet as Janis and Mann (1977) argued, there are generally recurring conditions in which such factors influence individual decisions. The question is, Under what conditions can we expect these factors to affect collective decisions? This paper suggests a general approach to identifying the effects of strategic misperception, illustrates it with an example of a social psychological process that affects player perceptions, and describes the preference distributions in which this simple process would change majority voting outcomes. The general conclusion is that strategic misperception may affect majority decisions under so many distributions of preferences that decisions cannot be predicted from knowledge of actors' preferences alone.",2-s2.0-34248452676,5,1984,Political Behavior,0

Any sociological description is an organisation of perspectives which necessarily throws certain ideas out of focus. The sociology of deviance has characteristically ignored one major quality of crime, its capacity to inflict distress upon people. Not all crimes impose suffering, and not all forms of inflicted suffering are illegal, but the criminal law is conventionally held to be concerned with the regulation of damage to the physical or material self. In its neglect of that quality, sociology has distorted its analysis of a number of problems. One such problem, that of motivation, is examined in this paper. It is argued that many deviant acts produce discomfort in others and a description of motives must comprehend how that discomfort is defined and tolerated by the deviant.",2-s2.0-84938050228,7,1979,Sociology,0

The accelerating process of globalization and the increasing interconnections between cultures involve an unprecedented challenge to contemporary psychology. In apparent contrast to these trends, academic mainstream conceptions continue to work in a tradition of cultural dichotomies (e.g., individualistic vs. collectivistic, independent vs. interdependent), reflecting a classificatory approach to culture and self. Three developments are presented that challenge this approach: (a) cultural connections leading to hybridization, (b) the emergence of a heterogeneous global system, and (c) the increasing cultural complexity. By elaborating on these challenges, a basic assumption of cross-cultural psychology is questioned: culture as geographically localized. Finally, 3 themes are described as examples of an alternative approach: a focus on the contact zones of cultures rather than on their center, the complexities of self and identity, and the experience of uncertainty.",2-s2.0-0000256249,6,1998,American Psychologist,0

Studies testing the assumptions of the hierarchical model are reviewed. A comparison between the circular and the hierarchical model in 18 data sets revealed an advantage of the hierarchical model. Additional support for the hierarchical model and the compatibility of this model with the findings of previous studies are reviewed.

Much of decision aiding uses a divide-and-conquer strategy to help people with risky decisions. Assessing the utility of outcomes and one's degree of belief in their likelihood are assumed to be separable tasks, the results of which can then be combined to determine the preferred alternative. Evidence from different areas of psychology now provides a growing consensus that this assumption is too simplistic. Observed dependencies in the evaluation of uncertain outcomes and the likelihood of the events giving rise to them are frequent and systematic. Dependencies seem to derive from general strategic processes that take into consideration asymmetric costs of over- vs. underestimates of uncertain quantities. This asymmetric-loss-function interpretation provides a psychological explanation for observed judgments and decisions under uncertainty and links them to other judgment tasks. The decision weights estimated when applying dependent-utility models to choices are not simply reflections of perceived subjective probability but a response to several constraints, all of which modify the weight of risky or uncertain outcomes.",2-s2.0-0009916479,6,1994,Psychological Bulletin,0

This study uses two data sets to examine racial/ethnic differences in three aspects of housing consumption - housing unit inadequacy, proximity to abandoned buildings, and home ownership - in the New York-New Jersey-Long Island metropolitan area and in New York City. In general, the results show that the spatial assimilation model explains the process of home ownership well, but that housing unit quality and neighborhood physical condition respond mainly to indicators of a family's purchasing power. After controlling for group differences in family composition and socioeconomic resources, Black and Hispanic families remained less likely than white families to live in high-quality units and neighborhoods, and all minority families were less likely to own their homes in both locations. These persistent disadvantages may partially reflect preferences for residence apart from whites (see Feagin 1994) but also suggest that the poorer treatment that minority home seekers receive from housing market agents helps to sort Black, Hispanic, and - to a lesser degree - Asian families toward lower-quality housing opportunities than those available to whites.",2-s2.0-0007242428,7,1996,Social Problems,0

Based on separating the effects of price and reference quality on demand, this analysis also provides insight into the contribution of these two effects to the steady-state solution through elasticities. Our results show that a monotonic inverse relationship exists between price and quality, such that a steady-state level is obtained where the quality-price ratio is lower when reference quality effects exist than when such effects do not exist. In other words, consumers obtain higher quality for a higher price but with a lower price per unit of quality.

It is often proffered that as a fiscal crisis worsens, the capitalist state increasingly relies on incarceration to better manage labor surplus. Using a multilevel study design, we analyze the interplay between the employment status of male criminal defendants charged with burglary and armed robbery and the unemployment rate on pretrial incarceration. We theorize that in cities with high unemployment, unemployed criminal defendants will be more likely to be incarcerated before trial. Additionally, because the state's punitive apparatus is thought to be geared specifically to control that segment of the surplus labor population which is most threatening to established interests, we examine whether unemployed African-American defendants are more apt to be incarcerated before trial in cities with a high unemployment rate. Results show that the unemployment rate moderates the relationship between employment status and pretrial incarceration. In cities with high unemployment, unemployed defendants have a substantially higher probability of pretrial detention. This effect withstands the introduction of control variables measuring a variety of individual and contextual factors. No support is found for the social dynamite thesis. That is, unemployed African-American defendants do not face a higher probability of pretrial confinement in cities with a high unemployment rate. We conclude that pretrial incarceration is determined, to a large extent, by the interaction between a defendant's employment status and aggregate labor market conditions.",2-s2.0-0036579204,7,2002,Social Problems,0
