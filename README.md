# New-Software-Identification

To install run:

    python setup.py install

You also need to install [pytorch](http://pytorch.org/), go here for instructions or if you have anaconda run:

    conda install pytorch torchvision -c soumith

I also highly recommend installing [Cuda](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads) if your machine has a GPU
